// SinkChain owns prev_hash for one sink. Each chained sink holds one.
// Compute is pure (no mutation); Commit advances prev_hash; Fatal latches
// the chain after an ambiguous durable-write failure.
//
// The same (formatVersion, sequence, prevHash, payload) under different
// keys produces different entryHash values - that is the entire point of
// per-sink chaining.
//
// Concurrency model: single-owner serialized use. SinkChain is mutex-safe,
// and concurrent Compute calls (with no intervening Commit) are pure and
// return identical results - they do not corrupt state. However, callers
// MUST NOT interleave Compute/Commit pairs across goroutines: Commit
// consumes a typed *ComputeResult and validates the result's generation
// against the chain's current generation, but the (sequence, generation)
// tuple alone does not identify which Compute call produced it within the
// same generation. The expected pattern is a single owner that issues
// Compute → durable write → Commit (or Fatal) in sequence per event.
//
// Compute/Commit token contract: Compute returns a *ComputeResult that
// callers MUST pass to Commit unchanged. ComputeResult is opaque
// (unexported fields, accessor methods) and chain-bound - only the
// SinkChain instance that produced the result can commit it. The
// unexported fields make literal construction or post-Compute mutation
// impossible from outside the audit package. Callers that need to persist
// the integrity metadata alongside the payload use EntryHash() and
// PrevHash(); see the lifecycle note below.
//
// Enforced invariants on Commit:
//   - nil ComputeResult → error (no latch).
//   - Post-Fatal Commit → ErrFatalIntegrity (no further latch).
//   - Cross-chain ComputeResult (one produced by a different SinkChain
//     instance) → ErrCrossChainResult, latches fatal on this chain.
//   - Backwards generation → ErrBackwardsGeneration, latches fatal.
//   - Stale prev_hash within the current generation, or non-empty prev_hash
//     on a rollover commit → ErrStaleResult, latches fatal.
//   - Otherwise, generation and prev_hash advance.
//
// Contract - what remains the caller's responsibility:
//
//   - Serialize Compute → durable write → Commit per record. SinkChain
//     does NOT detect concurrent overlapping Compute/Commit pairs from
//     multiple goroutines; the (sequence, generation) tuple is not a
//     unique identifier within a generation.
//   - Do not concurrently Compute+Commit across goroutines. Commit only
//     validates the result against the chain's CURRENT prev_hash; if two
//     goroutines race a Compute → Commit pair, the second Commit will
//     either appear stale (good - caught) or appear fresh (bad - silently
//     accepted) depending on interleaving. The single-owner pattern is
//     the only safe one.
//   - Only call Commit with a result whose durable write actually
//     succeeded. SinkChain has no knowledge of durable state; Commit on a
//     result whose write failed silently advances the in-memory chain
//     past an entry that does not exist in storage.
//
// Lifecycle / serialization boundary:
//
// A ComputeResult is bound to the in-memory SinkChain instance that
// produced it (chain-bound by pointer identity). It cannot be durably
// stored and committed later: a SinkChain reconstructed via NewSinkChain
// + Restore is a new instance and will reject prior tokens with
// ErrCrossChainResult. This is intentional - Compute and Commit are
// designed to be co-located in a single process, with the durable write
// of the integrity metadata happening between them.
//
// EntryHash() and PrevHash() exist so that callers can persist the
// integrity metadata alongside the payload for later VerifyHash. They are
// NOT the input shape for reconstructing a Commit token across process
// boundaries - there is no such API and no such need; the chain itself
// remembers what it has committed via prev_hash, and VerifyHash
// re-derives entry hashes from the persisted metadata.
//
// Recovery - a fatal latch makes the SinkChain instance unusable:
//
//   - All subsequent Compute calls return ErrFatalIntegrity.
//   - All subsequent Commit calls return ErrFatalIntegrity.
//   - The latch survives State()/Restore() round-trips (Fatal is part of
//     SinkChainState).
//   - The instance must be recreated via NewSinkChain (and a fresh
//     generation established externally - typically by rotating the
//     chain key and bumping the SequenceAllocator's generation, then
//     wiring a fresh SinkChain into the sink). There is no in-place
//     reset method by design: a fatal latch indicates an integrity
//     event the operator must observe.
