// probeCapabilityDrop reports whether the current process is running with a
// reduced Linux capability set compared to the kernel's maximum. It answers
// the question "is the capability-drop backend actually active for this
// process?" - not "is the capability-drop mechanism available on this
// kernel?". A server running with the full permitted and bounding sets
// (e.g. started as root without any drop) is reported as unavailable,
// because capability-drop is not protecting it even though the syscall
// machinery works.
//
// The probe checks two capability sets that represent *durable* privilege
// reduction:
//
//   - Permitted (capget): the upper bound the process can reinstate into
//     Effective via capset(2). A reduced Permitted set means the process
//     genuinely cannot regain those capabilities without exec+file-caps.
//
//   - Bounding (PR_CAPBSET_READ): the hard ceiling. A bit cleared here
//     cannot be regained at all, even across exec. This is what
//     capabilities.DropCapabilities() narrows via PR_CAPBSET_DROP, so
//     omitting it would miss aep-caw's own drop mechanism.
//
// The Effective set is deliberately excluded from the drop signal even
// though capget returns it: a process can do capset(eff=0, prm=full) and
// instantly restore Effective on the next syscall, so "CapEff reduced but
// CapPrm full" is a transient state, not a privilege drop. Reporting it
// as dropped would recreate the false positive cluster that #198 is
// trying to close.
//
// Detail text names which sets are reduced (permitted, bounding, or both)
// and the drop count so operators can see at a glance which lever is in
// use.
//
// Fallbacks:
//
//  1. If /proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap is unreadable (pre-2.6.25 kernels,
//     restricted procfs), the probe reports Available=true with an
//     explicit caveat in Detail - preserving pre-#198 permissive
//     behaviour on those platforms.
//  2. If PR_CAPBSET_READ fails during the bit walk (uncommon; some
//     lockdown or seccomp profiles block the extended prctl args), the
//     probe falls back to the Permitted-only check and notes the
//     bounding-set status as unknown in Detail. This preserves the
//     behaviour expected by environments where the process has dropped
//     its permitted set but bounding reads are blocked.
//
// See golang/go#44312 for why the V3 capget buffer must be a two-element
// CapUserData array even when callers only care about bits 0..31.
// readCapBoundingSet is the package-level hook used by probeCapabilityDrop
// to read the current bounding set. Tests override it to simulate
// environments where PR_CAPBSET_READ is blocked by seccomp/lockdown so
// the degraded-mode fallback can be exercised without affecting any
// other code paths.
