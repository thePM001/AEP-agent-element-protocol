	// has rec.Generation == tail.Generation; the lex compare degenerates

	// replay as the finite (ack_hw, wal_hw_at_entry] window before
	// advancing to live; without a hard stop, sustained appends would
	// prevent TryNext from ever returning ok=false and replay would
	// never terminate.

//     tail.Sequence by ONE record (the boundary record per NextBatch's
//     hard-stop rule), so Live MUST start at lastReplayed.seq+1, not
//     ackHW+1.
//  2. Still pass over the trailing-loss-marker WAL position: loss markers
//     bypass the Reader's nextSeq filter (see wal/reader.go nextLocked
//     near the isLossMarker branch), so Live's Reader will encounter and
//     surface any trailing loss marker that overflow GC appended at the
//     WAL tail mid-replay even though Live's start cursor is past the
//     marker's covered seq range.
//
// Without this contract, the trailing-loss-marker race that motivated
// the round-1 drain-until-ok=false fix would re-emerge as silent gap
// loss in the Live state.

// returns the next batch alongside a done flag. done=true means replay is
// complete and the caller should advance to the Live state. ctx is honoured
// between record reads - if it is cancelled, NextBatch returns its error.
//
// Termination rules (in order):
//
//  1. ctx cancelled → return (current-partial-batch, false, ctx.Err()).
//  2. RecordData with seq > tailSeq read → append the boundary record and
//     return done=true. tailSeq is a HARD upper bound: per spec
//     2026-04-18-wtp-client-design.md:586, replay is the finite
//     (ack_hw, wal_hw_at_entry] window before advancing to live. Without
//     this hard stop, sustained appends would prevent TryNext from ever
//     returning ok=false and replay would never terminate. The boundary
//     record is included because we have already read it from the Reader
//     and cannot push it back; the server treats EventBatch records
//     identically regardless of which state-machine state delivered them.
//  3. Reader is currently caught up (TryNext ok=false) → return done=true.
//  4. Batch caps hit (records or bytes) → return done=false, partial batch.
//
// Trailing-loss-marker race (documented for Task 17/22 Live state). While
// replay drains, overflow GC can drop a segment containing replay-era seqs
// and append a compensating loss marker AT THE WAL TAIL, with
// Loss.ToSequence <= tailSeq but a WAL position strictly beyond tailSeq.
// Two outcomes are possible:
//
//   - The Reader surfaces the loss marker BEFORE any over-tail RecordData.
//     NextBatch appends it to the batch (loss markers always surface and
//     do not contribute to the seq-vs-tailSeq check) and replay continues
//     normally.
//   - The Reader surfaces an over-tail RecordData first, NextBatch returns
//     done=true with the boundary record included, and the trailing loss
//     marker has not yet been seen. The Live state handler is responsible
//     for surfacing it: Live MUST open its Reader at
//     max(lastReplayedSeq+1, ackHW+1) - loss markers bypass the Reader's
//     nextSeq filter (see wal/reader.go nextLocked near the isLossMarker
//     branch), so the trailing marker WILL surface through Live's Reader
//     even though its covered seq range is past Live's start cursor.
//
// Loss records (RecordLoss) are appended verbatim and contribute neither
// to the byte cap accounting nor to the seq-vs-tailSeq check above.
