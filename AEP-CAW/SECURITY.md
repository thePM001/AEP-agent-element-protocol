# Security

This document describes the threat model, security mechanisms, and known limitations of aep-caw.

## Overview

aep-caw is a security sandbox for AI agent command execution. It interposes between an AI agent and the host system to enforce policies on file access, network connections, command execution, and environment variables.

## Threat Model

### What aep-caw Protects Against

aep-caw is designed to mitigate risks from **semi-trusted AI agents** operating within a defined workspace:

| Threat | Protection |
|--------|------------|
| Arbitrary file access | FUSE filesystem with policy-based access control |
| Credential theft via files | Deny rules for `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, `.env`, etc. |
| Credential theft via environment | Deny list for secrets + dangerous vars (LD_PRELOAD, etc.) |
| Unauthorized network access | eBPF/policy-based network filtering |
| Dangerous command execution | Command allowlists with args pattern matching; kernel-level enforcement via seccomp or ptrace |
| Resource exhaustion | cgroup limits (memory, CPU, PIDs) |
| Destructive operations | Approval workflows, soft-delete to trash, checkpoint/rollback |
| PII leakage to LLMs | Embedded proxy with DLP redaction before requests reach provider |
| Untracked LLM usage | Request/response logging with token usage for cost attribution |
| Unauthorized signal delivery | Signal interception with policy-based allow/deny/redirect |
| Process termination attacks | Signal rules blocking fatal signals to external/system processes |

### What aep-caw Does NOT Protect Against

aep-caw is **not** a full security sandbox like a VM or container with seccomp. It does not protect against:

| Threat | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **Kernel exploits** | Runs in userspace; kernel bugs bypass all protections |
| **Root-level attacks** | Assumes agent runs as unprivileged user |
| **Hardware side-channels** | No protection against Spectre/Meltdown-class attacks |
| **Malicious aep-caw binary** | Assumes aep-caw itself is not compromised |
| **Pre-existing malware** | Does not scan for or remove existing threats |
| **Social engineering** | Cannot prevent agent from outputting phishing content |
| **Denial of service to host** | Resource limits help but don't fully prevent |

```

**Trust assumptions:**
- The host kernel is trusted
- The aep-caw binary is trusted
- Policy files are trusted (not writable by agent)
- The AI agent is semi-trusted (may attempt policy violations)

## Security Mechanisms

### File Access Control (FUSE)

- Virtual filesystem mounted at `/workspace`
- All file operations intercepted and checked against policy
- Symlink escape prevention via `EvalSymlinks` + boundary checks
- Operations: read, write, create, delete, chmod, rename, etc.

**Policy evaluation:** First matching rule wins. Default is deny.

#### Deferred FUSE Mounting

In some environments (E2B, Firecracker, or other snapshot-based sandboxes), `/dev/fuse` is not accessible at session creation time but becomes available later at runtime. Deferred FUSE mounting delays the mount until the first `exec` call, then mounts idempotently.

**When to use:**
- Snapshot-restore environments where device permissions change at runtime
- Firecracker microVMs where `/dev/fuse` is gated behind a readiness marker
- Any setup where FUSE availability is delayed relative to session creation

**Configuration:**

```yaml
sandbox:
  fuse:
    enabled: true
    deferred: true
    # Optional: only run enable command when this file exists
    deferred_marker_file: "/tmp/.aep-caw-fuse-enabled"
    # Optional: command to make /dev/fuse accessible
    deferred_enable_command: ["sudo", "/bin/chmod", "666", "/dev/fuse"]
```

**Behavior:**
- On each `exec`, `ensureFUSEMount` checks if FUSE is already mounted (idempotent no-op if so)
- Calls `Recheck()` on the filesystem interceptor to re-probe `/dev/fuse`
- If still unavailable and `deferred_enable_command` is configured, runs the command (gated by `deferred_marker_file` if set)
- On success, mounts the FUSE overlay and emits a `fuse_mounted` event with `"deferred": true`
- On failure, emits `fuse_mount_failed` and continues without FUSE (non-blocking)

**Security considerations:**
- The enable command runs as the aep-caw process (not as the agent). If it uses `sudo`, ensure the sudoers policy is scoped to the specific command.
- The marker file should be writable only by trusted infrastructure (not by the agent), since its presence triggers the enable command.
- If `deferred_enable_command` is empty, no automatic enable is attempted - FUSE must become available through external means.

### Network Control (eBPF)

- Attaches to process cgroup before execution begins
- Filters connections by domain, CIDR, and port
- DNS resolution for domain-based rules (with timeout)

**Race condition mitigation:** Processes start in ptrace-stopped state; eBPF attaches before process resumes.

### Command Execution

- Pre-execution policy check on command + arguments
- Three matching modes:
  - **Basename:** `sh` matches any path ending in `/sh`
  - **Full path:** `/bin/sh` matches only that exact path
  - **Glob pattern:** `/usr/*/python3` matches `/usr/bin/python3`, `/usr/local/python3`
- Args pattern matching for dangerous flag combinations
- **Path canonicalization:** `filepath.EvalSymlinks` resolves symlinks before policy evaluation, preventing bypass via symlinks or `/proc/self/root` paths (relative path resolution is applied for `execveat` calls)
- **Transparent command unwrapping:** Wrapper commands (env, sudo, nice, ld-linux, etc.) are unwrapped to find the real payload; both wrapper and payload are evaluated with the most restrictive decision winning

**Default behavior:** Deny if no rule matches.

### Command Execution Enforcement (ptrace)

In environments where seccomp user-notify is unavailable (e.g. AWS Fargate, restricted containers), aep-caw uses ptrace-based syscall interception as an alternative enforcement mechanism.

**Implementation:**
- Uses `PTRACE_SEIZE` to attach without stopping the target process
- Intercepts `execve(2)` and `execveat(2)` syscalls at entry
- Reads filename and argv from tracee process memory via `/proc/<tid>/mem`
- Evaluates the same policy rules as seccomp mode
- Deny: sets syscall number to -1 (invalid), then fixes up return value with `-EACCES` on exit
- Auto-attaches to fork/clone/vfork children via `PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE`/`TRACEFORK`/`TRACEVFORK`

**Security properties:**
- Kernel-level enforcement: the denied syscall never executes
- Process tree tracking: all descendants are traced, preventing escape via fork+exec
- `execveat` with `AT_EMPTY_PATH` (fd-based exec) is intercepted alongside regular `execve`
- Path resolution: relative paths and fd-based paths are resolved to absolute paths for policy evaluation

**Limitations:**
- Currently intercepts execve/execveat only (Phase 1); file, network, and signal syscalls are classified but auto-allowed
- Small race window between fork and ptrace auto-attach
- Requires `SYS_PTRACE` capability (Linux-only)

**Configuration:** See [Security Modes - Ptrace Configuration](docs/security-modes.md#ptrace-configuration).

### Environment Variables

- Deny list for known secrets (AWS keys, API tokens, etc.)
- Deny list for code injection vectors:
  - Linux: `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `LD_AUDIT`
  - macOS: `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  - Languages: `PYTHONPATH`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `RUBYLIB`, `PERL5LIB`
  - Shell: `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `PROMPT_COMMAND`
- Allow/deny patterns configurable per-policy

**Operator-trusted injection (`env_inject`):**

The `sandbox.env_inject` configuration allows operators to inject environment variables that bypass policy filtering. This is intentionally powerful and should only be used by operators with config file access.

Primary use case: Setting `BASH_ENV` to point to a script that disables shell builtins (`kill`, `enable`, `ulimit`) which would otherwise bypass seccomp enforcement.

```yaml
sandbox:
  env_inject:
    BASH_ENV: "/usr/lib/aep-caw/bash_startup.sh"
```

**Security properties:**
- `env_inject` values bypass the deny list (operator explicitly wants them)
- Policy-level `env_inject` overrides global config (for per-policy customization)
- Trust boundary: config file access (not user-controllable)

### Resource Limits (cgroups v2)

- Memory limits (with swap disabled)
- CPU quota
- Process count limits
- Command and session timeouts

### Signal Interception (Linux)

aep-caw intercepts signal delivery between processes using seccomp user-notify, providing policy-based control over which signals can reach which targets.

**Implementation:**
- Uses `SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF` to trap signal syscalls (`kill`, `tkill`, `tgkill`, etc.)
- PID registry tracks all processes in the session for target classification
- Policy rules evaluated based on signal, sender, and target relationship

**Target Classification:**

| Target Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `self` | Process signaling itself |
| `children` | Direct child processes |
| `descendants` | All descendant processes |
| `session` | Any process in aep-caw session |
| `external` | PIDs outside session |
| `system` | PID 1 and kernel threads |

**Decision Types:**

| Decision | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `allow` | Signal delivered normally |
| `deny` | Returns EPERM to sender |
| `redirect` | Changes signal (e.g., SIGKILL → SIGTERM) |
| `audit` | Allow + log event |

**Platform Support:**
- **Linux**: Full blocking and redirect via seccomp user-notify
- **macOS**: Audit only via Endpoint Security Framework
- **Windows**: Partial blocking via ETW

See [Policy Documentation](docs/operations/policies.md#signal-rules) for configuration examples.

### Approval Workflows

Risky operations can require human approval before execution. aep-caw supports multiple approval modes:

**Approval Modes:**
- `local_tty`: Interactive terminal prompt with math challenge (default)
- `api`: Remote approval via REST API (for headless/remote deployments)
- `totp`: Time-based One-Time Password via authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
- `webauthn`: Hardware security key verification (YubiKey, platform authenticators) - highest security

**Key Features:**
- Configurable timeout (default: deny on timeout)
- Audit logging of all approval decisions
- Credential separation prevents agents from self-approving
- WebAuthn provides cryptographic proof of human presence

See [Approval Authentication](docs/approval-auth.md) for detailed configuration.

### Checkpoint and Rollback

aep-caw provides workspace checkpoint and rollback capabilities for recovery from destructive operations:

**Core Features:**
- **Copy-on-write snapshots**: File contents backed up before risky commands
- **Hash verification**: SHA-256 verification ensures rollback integrity
- **Auto-checkpoint triggers**: Automatic checkpoints before rm, mv, git reset, etc.
- **Diff inspection**: Compare current workspace to checkpoint state
- **Purge management**: Retention policies for storage management

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
# Create manual checkpoint
aep-caw checkpoint create --session <id> --workspace /path

# List checkpoints
aep-caw checkpoint list --session <id>

# Show checkpoint details and diff
aep-caw checkpoint show <cp-id> --session <id> --workspace /path --diff

# Preview rollback (dry-run)
aep-caw checkpoint rollback <cp-id> --session <id> --workspace /path --dry-run

# Perform rollback
aep-caw checkpoint rollback <cp-id> --session <id> --workspace /path

# Purge old checkpoints
aep-caw checkpoint purge --session <id> --older-than 24h --keep 10
```

**Auto-Checkpoint Configuration:**
```yaml
sessions:
  checkpoints:
    enabled: true
    storage_dir: /var/lib/aep-caw/checkpoints
    max_per_session: 50
    auto_checkpoint:
      enabled: true
      triggers:
        - rm
        - mv
        - git reset
        - git checkout
        - git clean
        - git stash
    retention:
      max_age: 168h  # 7 days
```

**Default Auto-Checkpoint Triggers:**
| Command | Risk |
|---------|------|
| `rm`, `rmdir`, `unlink` | File deletion |
| `mv`, `rename` | File movement (source lost) |
| `git reset` | Uncommitted changes lost |
| `git checkout` | Local modifications discarded |
| `git clean` | Untracked files deleted |
| `git stash` | Changes stashed (may be forgotten) |

**Safety Features:**
- Skips files larger than 100MB by default
- Skips hidden directories (.git, etc.)
- Dry-run mode for rollback preview
- Hash verification prevents corrupted restores

**Limitations:**
- Checkpoints only cover files, not external state (databases, APIs)
- Large workspaces may require significant storage
- Cannot checkpoint files outside the workspace

### External KMS Integration

aep-caw supports external Key Management Systems for HMAC keys used in audit integrity chains:

**Supported Providers:**
| Provider | Key Source | Envelope Encryption |
|----------|------------|---------------------|
| File/Env | Local file or environment variable | No |
| AWS KMS | AWS Key Management Service | Yes (GenerateDataKey) |
| Azure Key Vault | Azure Key Vault secrets | No (direct secret) |
| HashiCorp Vault | Vault KV v1/v2 secrets | No (direct secret) |
| GCP Cloud KMS | Google Cloud KMS | Yes (Encrypt/Decrypt) |

**Configuration Examples:**

```yaml
# AWS KMS (envelope encryption)
audit:
  integrity:
    enabled: true
    key_source: aws_kms
    aws_kms:
      key_id: "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789:key/abc-123"
      region: us-east-1
      encrypted_dek_file: /etc/aep-caw/audit-dek.enc  # Cache encrypted DEK

# Azure Key Vault
audit:
  integrity:
    enabled: true
    key_source: azure_keyvault
    azure_keyvault:
      vault_url: "https://myvault.vault.azure.net"
      key_name: "aep-caw-audit-key"
      key_version: ""  # Empty = latest

# HashiCorp Vault
audit:
  integrity:
    enabled: true
    key_source: hashicorp_vault
    hashicorp_vault:
      address: "https://vault.example.com:8200"
      auth_method: kubernetes  # token, kubernetes, approle
      kubernetes_role: aep-caw
      secret_path: "secret/data/aep-caw/audit-key"
      key_field: "hmac_key"

# GCP Cloud KMS
audit:
  integrity:
    enabled: true
    key_source: gcp_kms
    gcp_kms:
      key_name: "projects/my-proj/locations/us/keyRings/aep-caw/cryptoKeys/audit"
      encrypted_dek_file: /etc/aep-caw/audit-dek.enc
```

**Authentication:**
- **AWS**: Uses default credential chain (env vars, shared config, IAM role)
- **Azure**: Uses DefaultAzureCredential (managed identity, CLI, env vars)
- **Vault**: Supports token, Kubernetes, and AppRole authentication
- **GCP**: Uses Application Default Credentials

**Key Caching:**
- Keys are cached in memory after first retrieval
- For envelope encryption (AWS/GCP), encrypted DEK can be cached to disk
- Key refresh requires service restart

### Authentication and Authorization

aep-caw supports multiple authentication methods for API access:

**Authentication Types:**
- `api_key`: Static API keys with role-based access (agent, approver, admin)
- `oidc`: OpenID Connect/OAuth 2.0 for enterprise SSO integration (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- `hybrid`: Both API key and OIDC accepted (API key takes precedence)

**OIDC Features:**
- JWT validation with JWKS auto-discovery
- Group-based role mapping (groups containing "admin" or "approver" keywords)
- Allowed groups filtering for access control
- Token caching with secure hashing

**Role Separation:**
- `agent` role: Can execute commands, cannot approve
- `approver` role: Can view and resolve approval requests
- `admin` role: Full access including policy management

```yaml
# Example hybrid auth configuration
auth:
  type: hybrid
  api_key:
    keys_file: /etc/aep-caw/api-keys.yaml
  oidc:
    issuer: "https://corp.okta.com"
    client_id: "aep-caw"
    audience: "aep-caw"
    allowed_groups: ["aep-caw-operators"]
```

### MCP Security

aep-caw provides comprehensive security controls for Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool invocations:

#### Tool Whitelisting

Policy-based control over which MCP tools can be invoked:

```yaml
sandbox:
  mcp:
    enforce_policy: true
    fail_closed: true
    tool_policy: allowlist
    allowed_tools:
      - server: "filesystem"
        tool: "read_file"
      - server: "github"
        tool: "*"
```

| Policy Mode | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| `allowlist` | Only explicitly listed tools are permitted |
| `denylist` | Listed tools are blocked, all others allowed |
| `none` | No policy enforcement |

#### Version Pinning

Detect and optionally block MCP tool definition changes (rug pull detection):

```yaml
sandbox:
  mcp:
    version_pinning:
      enabled: true
      on_change: block  # block, alert, allow
      auto_trust_first: true
```

CLI management:
```bash
aep-caw mcp pins list
aep-caw mcp pins trust --server github --tool create_issue --hash sha256:...
aep-caw mcp pins reset --server github --tool create_issue
```

#### Rate Limiting

Token bucket rate limiting for MCP calls and network requests:

```yaml
sandbox:
  mcp:
    rate_limits:
      enabled: true
      default_rpm: 120
      default_burst: 20
      per_server:
        "slow-api":
          calls_per_minute: 30
          burst: 5
  network:
    rate_limits:
      enabled: true
      global_rpm: 600
      global_burst: 50
      per_domain:
        "api.openai.com":
          requests_per_minute: 60
          burst: 10
```

### LLM Proxy and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

aep-caw includes an embedded HTTP proxy that intercepts all LLM API requests from agents:

**Architecture:**
- Proxy starts automatically with each session on a random port
- Agent environment is configured to route through proxy (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`)
- Requests are intercepted, processed, and forwarded to upstream LLM providers

**DLP Redaction:**
- Request bodies are scanned for PII using regex patterns
- Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED:pattern_type]` before forwarding
- Built-in patterns: email, phone, credit card, SSN, API keys
- Custom patterns can be defined for organization-specific data

**Audit Logging:**
- All requests and responses logged to session storage (JSONL format)
- Token usage extracted and normalized across providers
- Redaction events tracked with field paths and pattern types

**Dialect Detection:**
- Anthropic: `x-api-key` or `anthropic-version` headers
- OpenAI API: `Authorization: Bearer sk-*` tokens
- ChatGPT: OAuth tokens (non-sk- Bearer tokens)

**Limitations:**
- Only scans text content (not images or encoded data)
- Regex patterns may miss obfuscated PII
- Agent could theoretically bypass proxy (combine with network rules for defense in depth)

See [LLM Proxy Documentation](docs/llm-proxy.md) for configuration and usage details.

## Known Limitations

### TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use)

File policy is checked when a file is opened. Between open and subsequent reads/writes, the underlying file could theoretically change (e.g., via hard links from outside the sandbox). This is inherent to userspace filesystem interception.

**Mitigation:** The window is small, and the agent cannot create hard links to files outside `/workspace`.

### DNS Rebinding

Network rules based on domain names resolve DNS at connection time. An attacker controlling DNS could potentially:
1. Resolve `evil.com` to an allowed IP during policy check
2. Change DNS to point to a blocked IP for actual connection

**Mitigation:** Use CIDR rules for critical blocks (e.g., metadata services at `169.254.169.254/32`). Domain rules are convenience, not security boundaries.

### Process Tree Escapes

If the eBPF/cgroup attachment fails after process start, child processes might execute before controls are in place.

**Mitigation:** Ptrace-stopped start ensures attachment completes before any user code runs. Hook failures result in process termination.

### Transparent Unwrap Heuristic

The transparent command unwrapping uses a simple heuristic to identify payload arguments (skip flags, env assignments, stop at first non-flag arg). This may misidentify a flag's value as the payload in some edge cases (e.g., `nice -n 10 wget` identifies `10` as the payload, not `wget`).

**Mitigation:** Misidentified payloads don't match any command rule and hit default-deny, which is the safe outcome. Network enforcement provides a backstop for the actual payload command.

### Approval Bypass via Timing

If an approval request times out, the operation is denied. However, a patient attacker could retry until a human mistakenly approves.

**Mitigation:** Audit logging; approval fatigue is a human factors problem.

## Platform-Specific Limitations

### macOS (darwin)

> **Alpha:** Native macOS enforcement via ESF+NE is in Alpha. It is functional end-to-end but not production-ready. For production macOS deployments, use Lima VM mode or Linux.

macOS has significantly reduced security enforcement compared to Linux due to platform limitations:

| Component | Linux | macOS | Impact |
|-----------|-------|-------|--------|
| File blocking | FUSE (enforced) | ESF (enforced via sysext) | **Enforced with system extension** |
| Network blocking | eBPF/iptables | pf (loopback only) | **Network policies incomplete** |
| Process isolation | Namespaces | sandbox-exec (minimal) | **Minimal isolation via SBPL profiles** |
| Resource limits | cgroups v2 | None | Memory/CPU limits not enforced |
| Syscall filtering | seccomp | None | Cannot restrict syscalls |
| Process tracking | ptrace/wait | Polling (100ms) | Processes may escape detection |

**Security tiers on macOS:**

| Tier | Score | Requirements | Capabilities |
|------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Enterprise | 90% | ESF + Network Extension (Alpha) | Full enforcement |
| Network Only | 50% | pf + root | Network only, file observation |
| Monitor Only | 25% | None | Observation only |
| Minimal | 10% | None | Command logging only |

**Current implementation status:**
- Endpoint Security Framework: **Implemented** (Alpha - file and process monitoring via AUTH/NOTIFY events)
- Network Extension: **Implemented** (FilterDataProvider + DNSProxyProvider)
- sandbox-exec: **Implemented** (SBPL-based process sandboxing, deprecated but functional)
- FSEvents fallback: **Observation only** (used when sysext is not installed)

**ESF+NE Enterprise Mode (Alpha):**

When running with ESF entitlements (requires Apple approval) and Network Extension (standard capability), aep-caw provides near-Linux-level enforcement:
- ESF (Endpoint Security Framework) intercepts file and process events with AUTH mode blocking
- Network Extension (FilterDataProvider + DNSProxyProvider) enforces network and DNS policies
- XPC bridge connects the System Extension to the Go policy engine
- Session tracking maps processes to aep-caw sessions for policy scoping

See [macOS ESF+NE Architecture](docs/macos-esf-ne-architecture.md) for deployment details.

**sandbox-exec Process Sandboxing:**

For non-enterprise deployments, aep-caw uses macOS's `sandbox-exec` command with SBPL (Sandbox Profile Language) profiles to provide minimal process isolation:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Default policy | Deny-all (`(deny default)`) with explicit allows |
| File access | Restricted to workspace and explicitly allowed paths |
| Network access | Denied by default, enabled via `capabilities: ["network"]` |
| System access | Read-only access to system libraries and frameworks |
| Temporary files | Full access to `/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, `/var/folders` |
| TTY/PTY access | Interactive terminal support for commands |
| IPC operations | POSIX IPC allowed; Mach/XPC configurable via `sandbox.xpc` |

**Default Readable Paths (Always Allowed):**

| Category | Paths |
|----------|-------|
| System libraries | `/usr/lib`, `/System/Library`, `/Library/Frameworks`, `/private/var/db/dyld` |
| System tools | `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/local/bin` |
| Homebrew | `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/Cellar` |
| Shared resources | `/usr/share` |
| Device nodes | `/dev/null`, `/dev/random`, `/dev/urandom`, `/dev/zero` |

**Configuration Options:**

```yaml
sandbox:
  # Primary workspace - full read/write access
  workspace: /path/to/workspace

  # Additional paths to allow (full access)
  allowed_paths:
    - /home/user/.config/myapp
    - /usr/local/share/data

  # Capabilities to enable
  capabilities:
    - network    # Enables network access (network*)
```

**SBPL Profile Structure:**

The generated profile follows this structure:
1. `(deny default)` - Start with deny-all
2. Allow process operations (fork, exec, self-signal)
3. Allow sysctl reads for system info
4. Allow reading system paths (libraries, frameworks, tools)
5. Allow TTY/PTY access for interactive commands
6. Allow temp file operations
7. Allow workspace full access (from config)
8. Allow additional paths (from config)
9. Conditionally allow network (if `network` capability set)
10. Allow Mach and POSIX IPC for inter-process communication
11. Apply mach-lookup restrictions (if `sandbox.xpc.enabled`)

**sandbox-exec Limitations:**
- `sandbox-exec` is deprecated by Apple but still functional on all macOS versions
- Provides file and network restrictions only (no process namespace isolation)
- Cannot enforce resource limits (CPU, memory)
- Cannot filter syscalls (unlike Linux seccomp-bpf)
- Profile is passed inline via `-p` flag
- No cgroup equivalent for resource accounting
- Child processes inherit the sandbox (escape via fork not possible, but no PID namespace isolation)

**XPC/Mach IPC Control:**

When `sandbox.xpc.enabled: true`, aep-caw restricts which XPC/Mach services sandboxed processes can connect to. This prevents:
- Data exfiltration via clipboard (`com.apple.pasteboard.1`)
- Privilege escalation via auth dialogs (`com.apple.security.authhost`)
- TCC bypass attempts (`com.apple.tccd.*`)
- AppleScript execution (`com.apple.coreservices.appleevents`)
- Accessibility API abuse (`com.apple.accessibility.*`)

Configuration:
```yaml
sandbox:
  xpc:
    enabled: true
    mode: enforce  # enforce | audit | disabled

```

Default allow list includes essential services: system logger, CoreServices, launch services, SecurityServer, and cfprefsd. See [macOS XPC Sandbox](docs/macos-xpc-sandbox.md) for full documentation.

**Recommendations for macOS deployments:**
- **ESF+NE (Alpha):** Install via `brew tap canyonroad/tap && brew install --cask aep-caw` for full enforcement
- Use containers (Docker/Podman) with Linux or Lima VM for production workloads
- Without the system extension, macOS operates in observation-only mode
- Do not rely on network policy enforcement without ESF+NE
- Consider the security score when evaluating risk

### macOS + Lima VM

For production macOS deployments requiring full Linux-level security, aep-caw supports Lima VM mode. When Lima is detected (running VM via `limactl`), aep-caw automatically delegates operations to the Linux environment inside the VM:

| Component | macOS Native | macOS + Lima | Impact |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| File blocking | ESF (sysext) | FUSE3 in VM | ✅ **Full enforcement** |
| Network blocking | pf (limited) | iptables DNAT | ✅ **Full enforcement** |
| Process isolation | None | Linux namespaces | ✅ **Full isolation** |
| Resource limits | None | cgroups v2 | ✅ **Full enforcement** |
| Syscall filtering | None | seccomp-bpf | ✅ **Available** |

**Lima Implementation Details:**

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Resource limits | cgroups v2 at `/sys/fs/cgroup/aep-caw/<session>` |
| CPU limits | `cpu.max` (quota/period in microseconds) |
| Memory limits | `memory.max` (bytes) |
| Process limits | `pids.max` |
| Disk I/O limits | `io.max` (rbps/wbps per device) |
| Network interception | iptables DNAT via `AEP_CAW` chain |
| TCP redirect | All outbound TCP (except localhost) to proxy port |
| DNS redirect | UDP port 53 to DNS proxy port |

**Security Score:** 85% (Full Linux capabilities with slight VM overhead)

**Recommendations for Lima deployments:**
- Use Lima for production macOS environments requiring isolation
- Lima automatically detected when `limactl` is installed with running VM
- Force Lima mode via config: `platform.mode: darwin-lima`
- VM overhead is ~200-500MB RAM with slightly slower file I/O via virtiofs

### Windows

Windows now has **kernel-level enforcement** via a mini filter driver, providing near-Linux-level security:

| Component | Linux | Windows | Impact |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| File blocking | FUSE (enforced) | Mini filter driver | ✅ **Enforced** |
| Network blocking | eBPF/iptables | WinDivert + WFP fallback | ✅ **Enforced** |
| Registry blocking | N/A | CmRegisterCallbackEx | ✅ **Enforced** |
| Process isolation | Namespaces | Driver session tracking | ✅ **Working** |
| Resource limits | cgroups v2 | Job Objects | ✅ **Working** |
| Process tracking | ptrace/wait | Driver + Job Objects | ✅ **Working** |

**Driver Components:**

| Component | Technology | Status |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Filesystem | FltRegisterFilter (Mini Filter) | ✅ **Enforced** - Create, write, delete, rename |
| Filesystem (alt) | WinFsp (cgofuse) | ✅ **Enforced** - FUSE-style mounting with soft-delete |
| Network | WinDivert (transparent proxy) | ✅ **Enforced** - TCP/DNS interception |
| Network fallback | WFP (Windows Filtering Platform) | ✅ **Block-only mode** |
| Registry | CmRegisterCallbackEx | ✅ **Enforced** - All operations |
| Process | PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx | ✅ **Tracking** - Session association |

**Registry Security Features:**

The driver provides comprehensive registry protection:

- **Operation interception:** Query, set, delete, create, rename keys and values
- **Policy enforcement:** Allow, deny, or require approval based on registry rules
- **High-risk path detection:** Automatic detection and blocking of persistence/security paths
- **MITRE ATT&CK mapping:** Events include technique IDs for security monitoring

| High-Risk Path | Risk | MITRE Technique | Default |
|----------------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `HKLM\...\CurrentVersion\Run*` | Critical | T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys | **Deny** |
| `HKLM\...\Winlogon*` | Critical | T1547.004 - Winlogon Helper DLL | **Deny** |
| `HKLM\SYSTEM\...\Services\*` | High | T1543.003 - Windows Service | **Approve** |
| `HKLM\...\Windows Defender\*` | Critical | T1562.001 - Disable Security Tools | **Deny** |
| `HKLM\...\Control\Lsa\*` | Critical | T1003 - Credential Dumping | **Deny** |
| `HKLM\...\Image File Execution Options\*` | Critical | T1546.012 - IFEO Injection | **Deny** |
| `HKLM\...\KnownDLLs\*` | Critical | T1574.001 - DLL Search Order Hijacking | **Deny** |

**Driver Fail Modes:**

| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `FAIL_MODE_OPEN` | Allow on service unavailable | Development, availability-first |
| `FAIL_MODE_CLOSED` | Deny on service unavailable | Production, security-first |

**Deployment Requirements:**

| Environment | Signing Requirement |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Development | Test signing (`bcdedit /set testsigning on`) |
| Production | EV code signing + Microsoft attestation |
| Enterprise | WHQL certification (optional, recommended) |

**Current implementation status:**
- Mini filter driver: ✅ **Enforced** (file create, write, delete, rename)
- WinFsp filesystem: ✅ **Enforced** (FUSE-style mounting via cgofuse, soft-delete support)
- WinDivert network: ✅ **Enforced** (TCP proxy, DNS interception)
- WFP fallback: ✅ **Block-only** (when WinDivert unavailable)
- Registry blocking: ✅ **Enforced** (all operations with high-risk protection)
- Process tracking: ✅ **Working** (driver-based session association)
- Policy caching: ✅ **Working** (configurable TTL, per-rule override)
- AppContainer sandbox: ✅ **Enforced** (process isolation with output capture)

**Recommendations for Windows deployments:**
- Use the mini filter driver for production deployments
- Enable `FAIL_MODE_CLOSED` for high-security environments
- Review registry policy rules - high-risk paths are blocked by default
- Monitor fail mode transitions in SIEM
- EV code signing required for production (no test signing)
- Consider WHQL certification for enterprise deployment
- WinFsp provides an alternative FUSE-style filesystem with soft-delete capabilities

**WinFsp Filesystem Mounting:**

WinFsp provides FUSE-style filesystem mounting on Windows using the shared `internal/platform/fuse/` package (cgofuse). This offers:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Cross-platform code | Same FUSE implementation works on Linux (FUSE3) and Windows (WinFsp) |
| Soft-delete | Files moved to trash instead of permanent deletion |
| Policy enforcement | Same policy engine as minifilter with file operation checks |
| Minifilter coexistence | Process exclusion prevents double-interception when both are active |

**Requirements:**
- WinFsp installed: `winget install WinFsp.WinFsp`
- CGO enabled build: `CGO_ENABLED=1 go build`

**Double-interception prevention:** When both minifilter and WinFsp are active, the Go client calls `ExcludeSelf()` before mounting to tell the minifilter to skip file operations from the aep-caw process, preventing duplicate event capture.

**AppContainer Sandbox Isolation:**

Windows 8+ supports AppContainer, a kernel-enforced capability isolation mechanism. aep-caw uses AppContainer as the primary process isolation layer, with the minifilter driver providing defense-in-depth:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Primary | AppContainer | Kernel-enforced capability isolation |
| Secondary | Minifilter driver | Policy-based file/registry rules |

**How It Works:**

When aep-caw executes a command in a sandboxed session, it:
1. Creates an AppContainer profile with a unique SID via `CreateAppContainerProfile`
2. Grants the container SID access to the workspace (read/write) via ACL modification
3. Grants the container SID access to system directories (read/execute)
4. Optionally adds network capability SIDs (internetClient, privateNetwork)
5. Spawns the process inside the container with extended startup info
6. Captures stdout/stderr via inheritable pipes
7. Cleans up ACLs (using `REVOKE_ACCESS` mode) and deletes the profile when done

**AppContainer Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Capability isolation | Kernel-level enforcement of allowed capabilities |
| Registry isolation | Automatic isolation of registry access |
| Network control | Configurable network access levels |
| ACL granting | Explicit path access required for file system access |
| Output capture | Full stdout/stderr capture from sandboxed processes |
| ACL cleanup | Automatic removal of granted ACLs on sandbox close |

**Network Access Levels:**

| Level | Capability SIDs | Use Case |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| `NetworkNone` | None | Maximum isolation (default) |
| `NetworkOutbound` | S-1-15-3-1 (internetClient) | Outbound connections only |
| `NetworkLocal` | S-1-15-3-3 (privateNetwork) | Private network only |
| `NetworkFull` | Both SIDs | Full network access |

**Configuration Options:**

```go
WindowsSandboxOptions{
    UseAppContainer:         true,  // Enable AppContainer (default)
    UseMinifilter:           true,  // Enable minifilter policy (default)
    NetworkAccess:           NetworkNone,  // Network level (default: none)
    FailOnAppContainerError: true,  // Fail hard on setup error (default)
}
```

**Isolation Level:** Windows reports `IsolationPartial` when AppContainer is available (capability-based, not namespace-based like Linux).

**AppContainer Limitations:**
- Requires Windows 8+ (version 6.2+)
- Capability-based, not namespace-based (sandboxed processes see all system processes)
- Cannot enforce resource limits (use Job Objects via minifilter for that)
- Cannot filter syscalls (no equivalent to Linux seccomp)
- Requires modifying filesystem ACLs for path access
- Profile names must not contain special characters (sanitized automatically)

**Recommendations for Windows sandboxed execution:**
- Enable AppContainer for process isolation (`UseAppContainer: true`)
- Combine with minifilter for comprehensive policy enforcement
- Use `NetworkNone` for commands that don't need network access
- Set `FailOnAppContainerError: true` in high-security environments
- Consider WSL2 mode for full Linux-level isolation

**Implementation:** See `internal/platform/windows/sandbox.go` and `internal/platform/windows/appcontainer.go`.

See [Windows Driver Deployment Guide](docs/windows-driver-deployment.md) for installation and configuration.

### Windows WSL2

For Windows deployments requiring full Linux-level security, aep-caw supports WSL2 mode. WSL2 runs a real Linux kernel, providing full Linux capabilities:

| Component | Windows Native | Windows WSL2 | Impact |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| File blocking | Mini Filter | FUSE3 in VM | ✅ **Full enforcement** |
| Network blocking | WinDivert | iptables DNAT | ✅ **Full enforcement** |
| Process isolation | AppContainer | Linux namespaces | ✅ **Full isolation** |
| Resource limits | Job Objects | cgroups v2 | ✅ **Full enforcement** |
| Syscall filtering | None | seccomp-bpf | ✅ **Available** |
| Registry monitoring | Mini Filter | N/A | ❌ Not available |

**WSL2 Implementation Details:**

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Resource limits | cgroups v2 at `/sys/fs/cgroup/aep-caw/<session>` |
| CPU limits | `cpu.max` (quota/period in microseconds) |
| Memory limits | `memory.max` (bytes) |
| Process limits | `pids.max` |
| Disk I/O limits | `io.max` (rbps/wbps per device) |
| Network interception | iptables DNAT via `AEP_CAW` chain |
| TCP redirect | All outbound TCP (except localhost) to proxy port |
| DNS redirect | UDP port 53 to DNS proxy port |

**Security Score:** 100% (Full Linux capabilities inside VM)

**Trade-offs vs Windows Native:**
- ✅ Full Linux security features (namespaces, seccomp, cgroups)
- ✅ Better isolation than AppContainer
- ❌ No Windows registry monitoring
- ❌ Slight VM overhead
- ❌ File I/O to Windows drives (`/mnt/c/`) slower than native

**Recommendations for WSL2 deployments:**
- Use WSL2 for maximum security on Windows
- Keep workspaces on Linux filesystem (`/home/...`) for best performance
- Install WSL2 with: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`
- aep-caw auto-detects WSL2 when running inside the VM

## Security Defaults

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in aep-caw:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers privately
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We aim to respond within 48 hours and will coordinate disclosure timing with you.

## Security Checklist for Operators

Before deploying aep-caw in production:

- [ ] Review and customize the default policy for your use case
- [ ] Ensure policy files are not writable by the agent user
- [ ] Enable audit logging and monitor for policy violations
- [ ] Set appropriate resource limits for your workload
- [ ] Use CIDR rules (not just domains) for critical network blocks
- [ ] Test approval workflows to ensure timeouts result in deny
- [ ] Run aep-caw as a non-root user
- [ ] Keep aep-caw updated for security fixes
- [ ] Configure DLP patterns for organization-specific sensitive data
- [ ] Enable network rules to force LLM traffic through the proxy
- [ ] Review LLM usage reports for unexpected token consumption
- [ ] Enable checkpoint/rollback for sessions running destructive commands
- [ ] Configure auto-checkpoint triggers appropriate for your workload
- [ ] For audit integrity, consider using external KMS (AWS/Azure/Vault/GCP) instead of local key files

## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-05-06 | v0.19.2: shim's kernelinstall path skips wrap-init when an ancestor's seccomp filter is already inherited (`/proc/self/status` `Seccomp_filters:`), avoiding nested-stacking failures masked as `ECANCELED` on Runloop devboxes (#282). Wrap-init now appends `dirname(AgentCommand)` to Landlock `allow_execute` (#283). `aep-caw-unixwrap` resolves the command path before installing the seccomp filter so `exec.LookPath` probes are not intercepted by the file-monitor handler (#283 bug B). Seccomp install raw kernel errnos are surfaced via `SCMP_FLTATR_API_SYSRAWRC`; `WAIT_KILLABLE_RECV` retry is gated on `EINVAL` (#285). |
