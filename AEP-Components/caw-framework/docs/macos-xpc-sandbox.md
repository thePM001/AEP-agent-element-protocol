# macOS XPC Sandbox

aep-caw provides XPC/Mach IPC control on macOS through sandbox profiles that restrict which system services sandboxed processes can communicate with.

## Overview

XPC (Cross-Process Communication) is macOS's primary IPC mechanism. By default, any process can connect to any XPC service. aep-caw's XPC sandbox restricts this using Apple's sandbox profile system.

## Configuration

```yaml
sandbox:
  xpc:
    enabled: true
    mode: enforce  # enforce | audit | disabled
    mach_services:
      default_action: deny  # deny (allowlist) or allow (blocklist)
      allow:
        - "com.apple.system.logger"
        - "com.apple.CoreServices.coreservicesd"
      block:
        - "com.apple.security.authhost"
      allow_prefixes:
        - "com.apple.cfprefsd."
      block_prefixes:
        - "com.apple.accessibility."
```

## How It Works

1. When `aep-caw exec` runs a command on macOS with XPC enabled, it wraps the command with `aep-caw-macwrap`
2. The wrapper generates an SBPL (Sandbox Profile Language) profile with mach-lookup rules
3. The sandbox is applied via `sandbox_init_with_parameters()` before exec
4. The sandboxed process can only connect to allowed XPC services

## Default Allow List

When `default_action: deny`, these services are allowed by default:
- `com.apple.system.logger` - System logging
- `com.apple.CoreServices.coreservicesd` - Core services
- `com.apple.lsd.mapdb` - Launch services
- `com.apple.SecurityServer` - Code signing
- `com.apple.cfprefsd.*` - Preferences

## Default Block List

When `default_action: allow`, these are blocked by default:
- `com.apple.accessibility.*` - Accessibility APIs (input injection)
- `com.apple.tccd.*` - TCC bypass attempts
- `com.apple.security.authhost` - Auth dialog spoofing
- `com.apple.coreservices.appleevents` - AppleScript

## Discovering Required Services

To find which XPC services your application needs:

```bash
# Trace sandbox violations
sandbox-exec -t /tmp/trace.out -p "(version 1)(deny default)(allow mach-lookup)" ./myapp

# Watch system log
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.sandbox"' --level debug
```

## Audit Events

XPC sandbox violations generate `xpc_sandbox_violation` events in the audit log.

## Dynamic Seatbelt (Policy-Driven Profiles)

Starting with dynamic seatbelt mode, sandbox profiles are no longer generated locally by `aep-caw-macwrap`. Instead, they are built server-side from policy YAML using the SBPL builder.

### How It Works

1. **Server-side compilation**: When a session starts, the server reads the active policy and compiles an SBPL profile using the SBPL builder. The profile encodes deny-default rules with specific allows for file paths, exec paths, Mach services, and network access derived from policy.
2. **Extension tokens**: Runtime file access grants are issued as sandbox extension tokens. These allow the sandboxed process to access paths not in the original profile (e.g., newly created temp files or workspace expansions) without regenerating the full profile.
3. **Pre-compiled delivery**: The compiled SBPL profile is sent to `aep-caw-macwrap` as part of the exec request. macwrap applies the pre-compiled profile via `sandbox_init_with_parameters()` instead of generating one locally.
4. **Backwards compatibility**: If `CompiledProfile` is empty in the exec request, macwrap falls back to legacy local profile generation. This ensures older servers or configurations continue to work without changes.
