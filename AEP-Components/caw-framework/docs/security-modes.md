# Security Modes

aep-caw supports multiple security modes depending on available kernel features. The system automatically detects available primitives and selects the best mode, or you can explicitly configure a specific mode.

## Overview

Security enforcement is provided through a combination of:
- **Landlock** - Kernel-enforced filesystem and network sandboxing
- **Seccomp** - Syscall filtering with user-notify support
- **Ptrace** - Syscall-level exec, file, network, and signal interception via PTRACE_SEIZE
- **FUSE** - Filesystem interception for fine-grained control
- **eBPF** - Network monitoring and policy enforcement
- **Capability dropping** - Linux capability restrictions

## Available Modes

| Mode | Requirements | Protection Level | Description |
|------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `full` | seccomp + eBPF + FUSE | 100% | Full security with all features |
| `ptrace` | SYS_PTRACE capability | ~95% | Exec, file, network, and signal interception via ptrace (for restricted containers) |
| `landlock` | Landlock + FUSE | ~85% | Kernel-enforced execution and FS control |
| `landlock-only` | Landlock | ~80% | Landlock without FUSE granularity |
| `minimal` | (none) | ~50% | Capability dropping and shim policy only |

### macOS Modes

| Mode | Requirements | Protection Level | Description |
|------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `esf` | System extension approved | ~90% | Endpoint Security Framework (Alpha) |
| `lima` | limactl available | ~85% | Full Linux enforcement inside Lima VM |
| `observation` | None | ~25% | Observation-only, no enforcement |

Dynamic seatbelt modes generate SBPL profiles from policy at session start - replacing blanket allows with deny-default + specific allows for file paths, exec paths, Mach services, and network. Extension tokens provide runtime file access grants. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-23-dynamic-seatbelt-design.md` for details.

### Mode Selection

By default, aep-caw auto-detects the best available mode at startup.

**Tip:** Use `aep-caw detect` to see what security features are available in your environment before configuring. See [Detecting Available Capabilities](cross-platform.md#detecting-available-capabilities).

## Configuration

### Security Mode Settings

```yaml
security:
  mode: auto              # auto | full | ptrace | landlock | landlock-only | minimal
  strict: false           # Fail if mode requirements not met
  minimum_mode: ""        # Fail if auto-detect picks worse than this
  warn_degraded: true     # Log warnings when running in degraded mode
```

### Landlock Configuration

When Landlock is available, configure filesystem and network restrictions:

```yaml
landlock:
  enabled: true

  # Directories where command execution is allowed
  allow_execute:
    - /usr/bin
    - /bin
    - /usr/local/bin

  # Directories where reading is allowed
  allow_read:
    - /etc/ssl/certs
    - /etc/resolv.conf
    - /lib
    - /lib64
    - /usr/lib

  # Directories where writing is allowed (beyond workspace)
  allow_write: []

  # Paths explicitly denied (applied by omission from ruleset)
  deny_paths:
    - /var/run/docker.sock
    - /run/docker.sock
    - /run/containerd/containerd.sock
    - /run/crio/crio.sock
    - /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io
    - /run/systemd/private

  # Network restrictions (requires kernel 6.7+ / Landlock ABI v4)
  network:
    allow_connect_tcp: true   # Allow outbound TCP connections
    allow_bind_tcp: false     # Allow listening on TCP ports
    bind_ports: []            # Specific ports if bind allowed
```

### Capability Configuration

Control which Linux capabilities are available to sandboxed processes:

```yaml
capabilities:
  allow: []   # Capabilities to keep (empty = drop all droppable)

  # Example: agent that needs to ping
  # allow:
  #   - CAP_NET_RAW
```

### Ptrace Configuration

When ptrace mode is selected (environments with `SYS_PTRACE` but no seccomp user-notify, e.g. AWS Fargate):

```yaml
ptrace:
  enabled: true

  trace:
    execve: true        # Intercept execve/execveat syscalls
    file: true          # File syscall tracing (openat, unlinkat, renameat2, mkdirat, etc.)
    network: true       # Network syscall tracing (connect, bind)
    signal: true        # Signal syscall tracing (kill, tkill, tgkill, rt_sigqueueinfo)

  # Anti-detection: mask TracerPid in /proc/*/status reads (default: false)
  mask_tracer_pid: "off"

  performance:
    max_tracees: 1024           # Maximum concurrent traced threads
    max_hold_ms: 5000           # Maximum time to hold a syscall for policy (fail-closed: deny with EACCES)
    seccomp_prefilter: true     # Use seccomp-BPF to filter non-traced syscalls

  on_attach_failure: fail_open  # "fail_open" or "fail_closed"
```

**Note:** Ptrace mode is mutually exclusive with `seccomp.execve` and `unix_sockets`. Enabling ptrace with either of these will cause a startup validation error.

**How it works:**
- Uses `PTRACE_SEIZE` (non-stopping) to attach to child processes and their descendants
- Intercepts `execve`/`execveat` syscalls at entry, reads filename/argv from tracee memory
- Intercepts file syscalls (`openat`, `openat2`, `unlinkat`, `renameat2`, `mkdirat`, `linkat`, `symlinkat`, `fchmodat`, `fchmodat2`, `fchownat`, plus legacy amd64 equivalents) with full path resolution including symlink handling
- Intercepts network syscalls (`connect`, `bind`) with sockaddr parsing for IPv4, IPv6, and Unix sockets
- Intercepts signal syscalls (`kill`, `tkill`, `tgkill`, `rt_sigqueueinfo`, `rt_tgsigqueueinfo`) with optional signal redirect via register rewrite
- Policy evaluation via `ExecHandler`, `FileHandler`, `NetworkHandler`, and `SignalHandler` interfaces
- Deny: invalidates syscall number (`nr = -1`), fixes up return value with `-EACCES`
- Two tracing modes: `TRACESYSGOOD` (all syscalls) or `TRACESECCOMP` (prefiltered via seccomp-BPF)
- Process tree tracking for fork/clone/vfork descendants with depth calculation
- `max_hold_ms` timeout enforcement: parked tracees (awaiting async policy approval) are automatically denied with `EACCES` if the timeout expires. Kill fallback if deny fails. Timeout is swept on every event loop iteration (not load-dependent).
- Graceful degradation: tracees that exit while parked are cleaned up automatically; resume requests for dead tracees are safely skipped; ESRCH errors in allow/deny trigger cleanup instead of SIGKILL
- DNS redirect: in-process dual-stack DNS proxy intercepts connect/sendto to port 53; tracee DNS queries are redirected to the proxy via sockaddr rewrite (when `NetworkHandler` is configured)
- SNI rewrite: TLS ClientHello interception on connect-redirect sockets; in-place SNI replacement with length field fixups (best-effort, single `write()` only)
- TracerPid masking: intercepts `/proc/*/status` reads on syscall-exit and patches `TracerPid` to `0` (when `mask_tracer_pid: true`)

**Monitoring:**

Ptrace mode exposes Prometheus metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint:
- `aep-caw_ptrace_tracees_active` - current number of traced threads (gauge)
- `aep-caw_ptrace_attach_failures_total{reason}` - attach failures by reason: eperm, esrch, other (counter)
- `aep-caw_ptrace_timeouts_total` - max_hold_ms timeout events (counter)

## Feature Matrix

### By Security Mode

| Feature | full | ptrace | landlock | landlock-only | minimal |
|---------|------|--------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Execution control (shim) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Execution control (kernel) | seccomp | ptrace | Landlock | Landlock | No |
| Filesystem (fine-grained) | FUSE | ptrace | FUSE | Landlock | No |
| Unix sockets (path-based) | seccomp | ptrace | Landlock | Landlock | No |
| Unix sockets (abstract) | seccomp | No | No | No | No |
| Socket family blocking (AF_ALG, AF_VSOCK, …) | seccomp | ptrace | No | No | No |
| Signal interception | seccomp | ptrace | No* | No* | No* |
| Network (kernel) | eBPF | ptrace | Landlock** | Landlock** | No |
| Resource limits | cgroups | cgroups | cgroups | cgroups | cgroups |
| Declared HTTP services | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

*Relies on PID namespace isolation + dropped CAP_KILL
**Requires kernel 6.7+ (Landlock ABI v4)

`http_services` enforcement runs entirely in the userspace proxy layer. It is not tied to any kernel primitive and applies identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows regardless of the active security mode.

Database access control is narrower today. The runtime DB proxy is Linux-only and targets Postgres-family services only; non-Linux builds include stubs that return unsupported for the proxy. Use native Linux, WSL2, or a Linux VM environment when you need `db_services`, `database_rules`, and `database_connection_rules` enforcement. MySQL, MongoDB, Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, ClickHouse, MSSQL, Cassandra, Redis, and Oracle are roadmap items, not current database enforcement targets.

### Landlock ABI Versions

| ABI | Kernel | Features Added |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| v1 | 5.13+ | Basic filesystem sandboxing |
| v2 | 5.19+ | File reparenting (REFER) |
| v3 | 6.2+ | File truncation control |
| v4 | 6.7+ | Network TCP restrictions |
| v5 | 6.10+ | IOCTL restrictions |

## Known Limitations

### In ptrace Mode

1. **DNS and SNI interception are best-effort**
   - DNS redirect intercepts UDP port 53 via connect and sendto rewriting to an in-process proxy
   - SNI rewrite handles single `write()` ClientHello only (no writev, sendmsg, or partial sends)
   - Neither is a security boundary - use the LLM proxy for API routing instead
   - Mitigation: shim-based policy checks still apply for command steering

2. **No FUSE or eBPF**
   - Ptrace mode is designed for environments without seccomp user-notify (e.g. AWS Fargate)
   - Fine-grained filesystem interception (FUSE path rewriting) and eBPF network monitoring are unavailable
   - Mitigation: ptrace intercepts the same file and network syscalls at the kernel level

3. **Performance overhead**
   - Each traced syscall requires two context switches (entry + exit) in TRACESYSGOOD mode
   - Seccomp prefilter (`seccomp_prefilter: true`) injects a BPF filter that returns `SECCOMP_RET_TRACE` only for traced syscalls; non-traced syscalls pass through at kernel speed
   - The prefilter is injected via ptrace syscall injection at attach time; injection failure falls back to TRACESYSGOOD (all syscalls trapped)
   - Per-syscall resume optimization uses `PtraceCont` instead of `PtraceSyscall` for entry-only syscalls, skipping unnecessary exit stops
   - Fd-aware exit stop optimization further reduces overhead by checking the fd tracker at entry: reads on non-status fds and connects to non-TLS ports skip the exit stop entirely
   - Single-threaded event loop may become a bottleneck with many concurrent tracees
   - Mitigation: Prometheus metrics (`aep-caw_ptrace_tracees_active`, `aep-caw_ptrace_timeouts_total`) help identify bottlenecks

4. **Attach race window**
   - In the exec path, a brief window exists between `cmd.Start()` and `PTRACE_SEIZE` where the child is untraced
   - Ptrace auto-attaches to fork/clone/vfork children via `PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE` etc.
   - The initial exec target is typically a known-safe binary; a pipe-based start barrier is planned for a follow-up
   - In the wrap path, the CLI connects to the server after the shell starts, sends the child PID, and waits for an ACK confirming attach before proceeding

5. **Timeout behavior is fail-closed**
   - When `max_hold_ms` expires on a parked tracee, the syscall is denied with `EACCES`
   - This prevents hung policy decisions from blocking the workload indefinitely
   - If both deny and kill fail, the tracee remains parked for retry on the next sweep

### In landlock and landlock-only Modes

1. **Signal interception disabled**
   - Without seccomp, signals cannot be intercepted at the kernel level
   - Mitigation: PID namespace isolation + dropped CAP_KILL prevents signaling external processes

2. **Abstract Unix sockets unprotected**
   - Landlock only controls path-based filesystem access
   - Abstract Unix sockets (those not backed by filesystem paths) cannot be blocked
   - Path-based sockets like `/var/run/docker.sock` are protected

3. **Network restrictions require kernel 6.7+**
   - Landlock network support (ABI v4) is only available on newer kernels
   - Without it, no kernel-level network enforcement is possible
   - eBPF-based network monitoring requires the `full` mode

4. **Landlock network rules are port-specific**
   - Landlock network rules must specify individual ports; there is no "allow all ports" wildcard
   - To allow unrestricted network access, network must be excluded from the handled access mask entirely
   - For selective restrictions (e.g., block bind but allow connect), specific port rules are required

5. **Symlink limitations in deny paths**
   - Symlinks pointing to denied paths are not explicitly detected during policy setup
   - However, Landlock operates on resolved paths, so protection is still enforced at the kernel level
   - Example: `/tmp/link -> /var/run/docker.sock` will be blocked by Landlock even if the symlink is added to allow paths

### In minimal Mode

- No kernel-level enforcement of execution or filesystem restrictions
- Relies entirely on shim-based policy checks
- Capability dropping provides baseline protection

## Strict Mode

When `strict: true`, aep-caw validates that all requirements for the configured mode are met:

```yaml
security:
  mode: full
  strict: true  # Fail startup if seccomp/eBPF/FUSE unavailable
```

### Mode Requirements

| Mode | Required Capabilities |
|------|----------------------|
| `full` | Seccomp with user-notify, eBPF, FUSE |
| `ptrace` | SYS_PTRACE capability |
| `landlock` | Landlock, FUSE |
| `landlock-only` | Landlock |
| `minimal` | (none) |

### Minimum Mode Requirement

Prevent auto-detection from selecting a mode weaker than desired:

```yaml
security:
  mode: auto
  minimum_mode: landlock-only  # Fail if Landlock is unavailable
```

## Startup Logging

When aep-caw starts, it logs the detected security posture:

```
INFO  security capabilities detected
        mode=landlock
        seccomp=false
        seccomp_basic=false
        landlock=true
        landlock_abi=4
        landlock_network=true
        ebpf=false
        fuse=true
        ptrace=false
        capabilities=true
WARN  running in degraded security mode
        mode=landlock
        signal_interception=disabled
        unix_socket_interception=path-based-only
```

## Capability Dropping

Regardless of security mode, aep-caw drops dangerous Linux capabilities:

### Always Dropped (Cannot Be Allowed)

| Capability | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` | Mount, namespace escape, catch-all |
| `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` | Attach to processes, read memory |
| `CAP_SYS_MODULE` | Load kernel modules |
| `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` | Bypass file permissions |
| `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` | Bypass read/search permissions |
| `CAP_SETUID` / `CAP_SETGID` | Change UID/GID |
| `CAP_SETPCAP` | Modify capability bounding set (could re-add dropped caps) |
| `CAP_CHOWN` | Change file ownership |
| `CAP_FOWNER` | Bypass owner permission checks |
| `CAP_MKNOD` | Create device files |
| `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` | Raw I/O port access |
| `CAP_SYS_BOOT` | Reboot system |
| `CAP_NET_ADMIN` | Network configuration |
| `CAP_SYS_CHROOT` | chroot escape vector |
| `CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE` | Modify immutable files |

### Default Dropped (Can Be Explicitly Allowed)

| Capability | Use Case If Needed |
|------------|-------------------|
| `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` | Bind to ports < 1024 |
| `CAP_NET_RAW` | Raw sockets (ping) |
| `CAP_KILL` | Signal any same-UID process |
| `CAP_SETFCAP` | Set file capabilities |

## Policy Derivation

Landlock execute paths are automatically derived from command policy rules:

```yaml
# This command policy...
commands:
  - name: allow-git
    full_paths:
      - /usr/bin/git
    decision: allow

  - name: allow-node
    path_globs:
      - /usr/local/bin/node*
    decision: allow

# ...automatically allows execution in:
#   - /usr/bin
#   - /usr/local/bin
```

Explicit `landlock.allow_execute` paths are merged with derived paths.

## Session Enforcement Flow

When a command is executed in a session, the enforcement path depends on the active security mode:

### Seccomp/Full Mode

```
1. Pre-fork policy check (shim validates command)
2. Fork child process (with seccomp wrapper)
3. Set PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS
4. Drop capabilities
5. Apply Landlock ruleset
6. Apply cgroup limits (if available)
7. Execute actual command (seccomp user-notify intercepts syscalls)
```

### Ptrace Mode

```
1. Pre-fork policy check (shim validates command)
2. Fork child process (normal start, no seccomp wrapper)
3. Tracer attaches via PTRACE_SEIZE + PTRACE_INTERRUPT (stops process)
4. Apply cgroup limits while process is stopped
5. Tracer resumes process
6. Tracer intercepts syscalls for ongoing enforcement
```

Note: In ptrace mode, there is a brief pre-attach window between fork and PTRACE_SEIZE where the child process may execute a few instructions untraced. This is acceptable for Phase 1 since the initial exec target is typically a known-safe binary path, and the seccomp prefilter auto-attaches to fork/clone descendants.

## Performance Benchmarks

Measured with `make bench`, which runs a Dockerized workload under each mode (baseline with sandbox disabled, full seccomp+FUSE, ptrace with seccomp prefilter + config-driven BPF filter + config-aware exit stops + lazy BPF escalation + PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO) using a realistic policy with deny, redirect, and allow rules plus full audit logging. Results are median of 3 runs.

### Results

| Phase | Baseline | Full mode | Full overhead | Ptrace | Ptrace overhead |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Process spawn (120 execs) | 3549ms | 3458ms | -2.6% | 11846ms | +234% |
| File I/O (1000 ops) | 282ms | 275ms | -2.5% | 560ms | +99% |
| Git workflow (clone+grep+commit) | 53ms | 51ms | -3.8% | 323ms | +509% |
| Network (10 curl) | 368ms | 339ms | -7.9% | 7185ms | +1852% |
| Deny enforcement (50 blocked) | 631ms | 551ms | -12.7% | 674ms | +7% |
| Redirect enforcement (50 redirected) | 1787ms | 1733ms | -3.0% | 4351ms | +143% |
| Deep process tree (20x 4-level) | 650ms | 624ms | -4.0% | 8249ms | +1169% |
| Wide process tree (10x 10-fan) | 327ms | 316ms | -3.4% | 1341ms | +310% |
| **Total** | **7647ms** | **7347ms** | **-3.9%** | **34529ms** | **+352%** |

### Analysis

**Full mode** (seccomp+FUSE) adds **<1% total overhead**. Non-file phases show no measurable overhead.

**Ptrace mode** adds **~3.5x total overhead** with all optimizations enabled. This is expected - ptrace intercepts syscalls via context switches rather than kernel-internal notification. Breakdown:

1. **Per-exec RPC dominates.** Each `aep-caw exec` call goes through CLI → HTTP → server → fork/exec (~30ms). The ptrace attach (PTRACE_SEIZE + seccomp BPF injection + WaitAttached) adds ~15ms per exec on top.

2. **Deny enforcement is free.** Policy deny short-circuits before fork, so ptrace overhead is zero for denied commands.

3. **File I/O is moderate (~2x).** The 1000-op file phase runs inside a single exec through the workspace directory. Ptrace traps each `openat`/`unlinkat` at entry. Config-aware exit stops skip `openat` exit processing when `MaskTracerPid` is off - saving one context switch per file operation. The narrow BPF filter excludes read/write, so file reads pass through untraced.

4. **Network is the worst case (~19x).** `curl` generates hundreds of syscalls (DNS, TLS, connect, read/write). The config-driven BPF filter removes `socket`, `listen`, and `close` from the traced set when fd tracking is inactive - saving ~15-25 ptrace stops per curl invocation. Lazy BPF escalation keeps read/write out of the traced set for processes that don't need them.

5. **Process trees scale with depth (~12x).** Deep nesting (sh→sh→sh→sh→true) multiplies the per-exec attach cost. Wide fan-out (10 parallel children, ~4x) is better since children inherit the seccomp filter via fork.

6. **PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO** provides a lighter entry path (~96 bytes vs 216 bytes for full register read) for syscall dispatch. All handlers (`handleExecve`, `handleFile`, `handleNetwork`, `handleSignal`) use `SyscallContext.Info.Args` directly on the allow path without loading full registers. `PTRACE_GETREGS` is only called for redirect/rewrite operations.

7. **Config-driven BPF filter** removes always-allowed syscalls (`socket`, `listen`) and conditionally-needed syscalls (`sendto`, `close`) from the seccomp filter. This eliminates ptrace stops for syscalls that would always be allowed by the handler.

8. **Static deny support** via `SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO` enables BPF-level enforcement for policies that always deny certain syscalls (e.g., all network connections). Denied operations are handled entirely in-kernel without any ptrace stop.

9. **Ptrace mode is designed for restricted environments** (e.g., AWS Fargate) where seccomp user-notify, eBPF, and FUSE are unavailable. The overhead tradeoff is acceptable for these environments where no alternative enforcement mechanism exists.

### Reproducing

```bash
make bench
```

Requires Docker with `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN --cap-add SYS_PTRACE --device /dev/fuse --security-opt seccomp=unconfined`. Total runtime ~15-20 minutes.
