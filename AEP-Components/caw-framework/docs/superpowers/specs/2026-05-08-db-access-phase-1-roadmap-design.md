# DB Access Phase 1 - Implementation Roadmap

**Status:** Design approved 2026-05-08. Decomposes implementation of `docs/aep-caw-db-access-spec.md` v0.8 (PostgreSQL) into seven sequenced plans.
**Owner:** Canyon Road
**Source spec:** [`docs/aep-caw-db-access-spec.md`](../../aep-caw-db-access-spec.md) v0.8 (APPROVED FOR PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION)

This document is the *roadmap*, not the spec. It commits to plan decomposition, package layout, dependencies, and cross-cutting build/runtime decisions. Each individual plan gets its own brainstorming pass at the time it is started, producing its own per-plan design doc and implementation plan. This avoids spec drift compounding across seven plans built over many weeks.

---

## 1. Decomposition

Seven plans, with Plan 04 split into four sub-plans across two brainstorming passes. Plans 01-03 are pure libraries; Plan 04a introduces the first socket (no protocol semantics); Plan 04b adds inbound handshake + TLS termination; Plan 04b₂ adds upstream wiring + passthrough mode + replication/cancel; Plan 04c adds the Simple Query path; Plans 05-06 are siblings on top of Plan 04c; Plan 07 closes the loop with unavoidability and integration tests.

```

Dependency notes:

- Plan 01 unblocks Plans 02 and 03.
- Plan 02 depends only on Plan 01 - it operates on `ClassifiedStatement`, which Plan 01 defines.
- Plan 03 depends on Plans 01 and 02. The §23.1 golden corpus rows include `expected_decision_under_sample_policy`, so Plan 02's evaluator and `corpus/sample-policy.yaml` must be merged before Plan 03's CI gate can be wired.
- **Plan 04 was split during brainstorming on 2026-05-10** when the unified scope became too large for a single plan. The original three sub-plans were sequential: 04a (listener skeleton, no protocol), 04b (handshake + TLS + upstream auth), 04c (Simple Query + DBEvent emission). The shared design doc `2026-05-10-db-plan-04-pg-proxy-skeleton-design.md` covers all four sub-plans; each has its own implementation plan.
- **Plan 04b was further split during writing-plans on 2026-05-10** into 04b (inbound handshake + TLS termination only; passthrough mode rejected at `Server.New`; allow path returns `ErrorResponse(0A000, UPSTREAM_NOT_YET_WIRED)`) and 04b₂ (upstream TCP dial, upstream TLS, auth-byte forwarding, SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS fail-closed, post-handshake byte-passthrough, passthrough TLS mode end-to-end, replication opt-in, CancelRequest dispatch, degraded_visibility events, per-mode spine round-trip test). Aggregate scope unchanged versus the original 04b.
- Plan 04a depends on Plans 01-02 only (no classifier needed for an empty listener). Plan 04b depends on 04a. Plan 04b₂ depends on 04b. Plan 04c depends on 04b₂ and on Plan 03 (Simple Query path needs the classifier).
- Plans 05 and 06 are siblings on top of Plan 04c. Extended Query / transaction state (Plan 05) and CancelRequest mapping (Plan 06) touch different parts of the proxy and may proceed in parallel after Plan 04c lands.
- Plan 07 depends on Plans 04c - 06 - integration tests need a real proxy.

Externally visible behavior:

- Plans 01-03 ship on `main` with no behavior change (types, pure functions, CLI tool only).
- Plans 04a - 04c ship behind `policies.db.unavoidability: off` (default). With flag = `off`, no listener is bound and the package is a no-op. With flag = `observe`, listeners bind from Plan 04a, complete *inbound* handshakes from Plan 04b (returning `0A000` after StartupMessage), complete *full* handshakes through to upstream `ReadyForQuery` from Plan 04b₂, and emit `db_statement` events from Plan 04c.
- Plan 04c introduces recognition of `db_services` config end-to-end (declared services intercept queries when flag is `observe`).
- Plan 07 ships the unavoidability bundle and makes `enforce` the recommended high-assurance default.

## 2. Package layout

Single tree under `internal/db/`. Each plan owns one sub-package; cross-package types live at the top.

```
internal/db/
├── effects/                       # plan 01: Effect, ClassifiedStatement, groups, subtypes, aliases, ordering
├── policy/                        # plan 02: RuleSet, Decision, Evaluate(); rule struct types
├── events/                        # plan 01 (skeleton) + plan 04 (emission): DBEvent, redaction levels
├── service/                       # plan 01 (config schema) + plan 07 (bundle generator)
├── classify/

└── listener/                      # plan 07: //go:build linux; SO_PEERCRED, SessionID-keyed identity
cmd/
└── dbclassify-pg/                 # plan 03: CLI; reads SQL on stdin, prints classification
```

Build constraints:

- `effects`, `policy`, `events`, `service` build on every platform - no CGO, no Linux-only syscalls.
- `classify/postgres` builds on every platform via the `Parser` interface split. Consumers see only the interface; the build tags hide which backend is selected.
- `proxy/postgres` and `listener` are Linux-only. Non-Linux gets a stub returning `errors.ErrUnsupported`. The CLAUDE.md `GOOS=windows go build ./...` requirement is preserved.

Boundary calls:

- `internal/proxy/` (HTTP/MCP) and `internal/db/proxy/postgres/` are intentionally separate. Phase 1 does **not** introduce a shared proxy abstraction; that is a Phase 2+ concern when MySQL lands and shared patterns become visible.
- `internal/policy/` is unchanged. The DB rule schema lives in `internal/db/policy/`; `internal/policy/load.go` gains a small registration hook in Plan 02 so YAML files containing `database_rules` / `database_connection_rules` parse and validate without error even before the proxy exists.
- The unavoidability bundle generator (Plan 07) emits standard supervisor inputs (`dest` rules, network rules, file rules over Unix sockets). It does not bypass or reach into the supervisor; it produces config the supervisor already understands.

## 3. Per-plan scope

Plan files land at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-MM-DD-db-plan-NN-<slug>.md`. The `plan-NN-` prefix matches the existing `external-secrets` decomposition convention so ordering reads off `ls`.

### Plan 01 - `db-plan-01-taxonomy-effects.md`

Spec-§: 5, 6, 8 (skeleton), 9.1; §23.4 steps 1-2.

Deliverables:

- `internal/db/effects/`: risk-tier enum (`safe`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`), group enum (`read`, `write`, `modify`, `delete`, `bulk_load`, `bulk_export`, `unsafe_io`, `schema_create`, `schema_alter`, `schema_destroy`, `privilege`, `procedural`, `unknown`), subtypes (§5.1), alias table (§5.4 with R23 CREATE-not-INSERT callout), `Effect` and `ClassifiedStatement` structs, canonical effect-ordering function (§5.2 with R5 tie-break order: `unknown > unsafe_io > schema_destroy > bulk_export > privilege` for critical tier).
- `internal/db/service/`: `db_services` config schema parsing only (no bundle generation yet).
- `internal/db/events/`: `DBEvent` struct skeleton; redaction-level enum (§10.3 with R4 enum `none | parameters_redacted | full`); `external_endpoint` value type (§5.2 R8 with `kind`, `host`, `port`).

Tests: exhaustive table-driven tests for ordering, alias resolution, subtype assignment.

External behavior: none.

### Plan 02 - `db-plan-02-policy-evaluator.md`

Spec-§: 9, 10; §23.3, §23.4 step 3.

Deliverables:

- `internal/db/policy/`: `StatementRule`, `ConnectionRule`, `RuleSet` types; glob compilation; `Evaluate(ClassifiedStatement, RuleSet) → Decision`.
- §10.2 implementation: collect-all coverage; any-deny-wins; most-restrictive verb decides; R14 order-independence; R15 approve+audit overlap (`decision.contributing_audit_rules` populated, but verb stays `approve`); R16 multi-glob coverage per-object; `match_object_resolution` per-effect.
- §10.3 statement-text redaction tier (default `parameters_redacted`).
- Config-load validation per §9.4 with R13 audit-on-dangerous warning (silenced by `acknowledge_audit_on_dangerous: true`).
- Registration hook in `internal/policy/load.go` so policy YAML files containing `database_rules` parse without error.
- `corpus/sample-policy.yaml` - single source of truth for Plan 03's golden corpus `expected_decision_under_sample_policy` column.

Tests: §23.3 categories - strict object coverage (allow, audit, approve), implicit deny on uncovered objects, audit-as-coverage, approve does not extend coverage, deny precedence, `match_object_resolution` per-effect, multi-effect mixed decisions, risk-tier-first primary effect ordering.

External behavior: none. Policy YAML referencing `database_rules` no longer fails to load.

### Plan 03 - `db-plan-03-pg-classifier.md`

Spec-§: 7, 20, Appendix B; §23.1, §23.4 step 4.

Deliverables:

- `internal/db/classify/postgres/parser.go`: `Parser` interface - single public surface.
- `libpgquery.go` (`//go:build linux && cgo`): `pganalyze/pg_query_go` bindings.
- `fallback.go` (`//go:build !linux || !cgo`): pure-Go parser (CockroachDB parser fork). Documented divergence policy: when the fallback cannot produce an AST, classify as `unknown` rather than guess.
- AST→effect mapping per §7.3 + Appendix B (Postgres `unsafe_io` and `bulk_export` reference table).
- Multi-statement composition (§5.3), unmapped-form behavior (§7.7), classifier-failure semantics (§7.8).
- `corpus/`: golden fixtures, one `.yaml` per row, schema `(wire_bytes_in, expected_classification, expected_decision_under_sample_policy)`. CI fails on mismatch.
- `parser_backend` field surfaced in `ClassifiedStatement` and propagated to `DBEvent`.
- `cmd/dbclassify-pg`: CLI tool reading SQL on stdin, printing classification + decision under the sample policy. Useful for spec authors and corpus extension.

Tests: corpus-driven; backend cross-validation tests where libpg_query and fallback both succeed and must agree on group/risk-tier.

External behavior: new CLI binary; no runtime change.

### Plan 04 - split into 04a / 04b / 04c during 2026-05-10 brainstorming

The unified Plan 04 was split into three sub-plans during brainstorming when the combined scope (framing + handshake + TLS + simple-query + listener auth + events) became too large for a single plan. The shared design doc `2026-05-10-db-plan-04-pg-proxy-skeleton-design.md` covers all three sub-plans; each has its own implementation plan file. Spec-section coverage and roadmap §23.4 step coverage are unchanged in aggregate.

#### Plan 04a - `db-plan-04a-listener-skeleton.md`

Spec-§: 11.3 (listener part), 12.5 (UID-only listener auth subset); §23.4 step 5 (skeleton work).

Deliverables:

- `internal/db/service/flag.go`: `Unavoidability` enum (`off | observe | enforce`); `internal/policy/load.go` parses `policies.db.unavoidability`.
- `internal/db/proxy/postgres/` package skeleton (`//go:build linux`); non-Linux stub returning `errors.ErrUnsupported`.
- `Server` lifecycle: `New` / `Start` / `Shutdown`; binds Unix-socket listeners per declared `db_service`, accept loop, graceful drain, listener cleanup. Sentinel-server short-circuit when flag = `off`.
- SO_PEERCRED + UID-equality listener auth on Linux; emits `db_listener_auth_fail` event on mismatch and silently closes.
- `internal/db/events/sink.go`: `Sink` interface, `NopSink`, in-memory `SyncSink` test fake.
- `internal/db/policy/validate.go` extension: reject connection rules under `tls_mode: passthrough` that match passthrough-invisible fields (`db_user`, `database`, `application_name`).
- `internal/api` wiring: instantiate `Server` at startup when flag != `off` and `db_services` non-empty.

Tests: bind/unbind, peercred mismatch, peercred match, shutdown drains in-flight, sentinel server is no-op, validate.go rejects passthrough-invisible field rules.

External behavior under flag = `observe`: declared `db_service` listener exists; connections are accepted from the right uid and immediately closed (no protocol code yet).

#### Plan 04b - `db-plan-04b-handshake-tls.md`

Spec-§: 7.1 (framing), 11.1 (startup-packet dispatch), 11.3 (handshake parts), 13 (TLS modes); §23.4 step 5 (handshake/TLS work) + step 7 (degraded-visibility events).

Deliverables:

- pgproto3 dependency (`github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgproto3`) and per-connection framing wrappers.
- `internal/db/tlsleaf/`: lazy self-signed CA (load-or-create under StateDir) + per-hostname leaf issuer with in-process LRU cache.
- Startup-packet dispatch: `SSLRequest`, `GSSENCRequest`, `CancelRequest`, `StartupMessage`.
- Three TLS modes: `terminate_reissue`, `terminate_plaintext_upstream` (with config-load loopback/RFC1918 check), `passthrough` (with best-effort SNI extraction and `degraded_visibility_warning` at first connect).
- Replication detection → default-deny; opt-in path enters byte-passthrough and emits `degraded_visibility_warning`.
- `connect`-kind connection-rule evaluation via Plan 02's existing `policy.EvaluateConnection`. `cancel`-kind eval too; CancelRequest forwards un-mapped (Plan 06 owns mapping).
- Upstream TCP connect + auth-byte forwarding; SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS detection at upstream auth → fail-closed with `db_handshake_fail` event.

Tests: per-mode TLS round-trip with fake upstream, SCRAM fail-closed, replication default-deny, cancel un-mapped forward, degraded_visibility events.

External behavior under flag = `observe`: clients can complete a handshake and reach `ReadyForQuery` through the proxy. The proxy then drops the connection because no statement path exists yet.

#### Plan 04c - `db-plan-04c-simple-query-events.md`

Spec-§: 8 (DBEvent), 11.2 (architecture diagram for simple-query parts), 14.1 / 14.4 (Simple Query semantics, pre-forward); §23.4 step 5 (statement path) + step 7 (DBEvent emission).

Deliverables:

- RFQ status-byte tracker per connection (one byte; updated on observed `ReadyForQuery` from upstream).
- `'Q'` frame classify (Plan 03's `Parser`) + evaluate (Plan 02's `Evaluate`) per-statement; multi-statement parse-all-before-forward.
- Deny synthesis: `ErrorResponse` + `ReadyForQuery('I')` locally when out-of-tx; in-tx terminate (close upstream + client) when `lastUpstreamRFQ ∈ {T, E}`.
- `approve` → `deny + APPROVE_NOT_YET_SUPPORTED` runtime stub + config-load warning when any rule has `decision: approve`.
- Frame budget cap (`MaxQueryBytes`, default 1 MiB) → synthetic `54000` + close.
- Eventbuilder: `ClassifiedStatement` + `Decision` → `DBEvent` with redaction tiers (`full` / `parameters_redacted` / `none`); `statement_digest` = SHA-256 of the normalized form.
- Spine integration test: real `jackc/pgx/v5` client → real `Server` (terminate_reissue) → fake upstream goroutine; assert query result reaches client + one `db_statement` event in `SyncSink`.

Tests: classify+evaluate+forward (allow/audit), deny synth out-of-tx, in-tx terminate, multi-statement deny semantics, approve→deny stub, redaction tiers, statement_digest stability across tiers, spine round-trip.

External behavior under flag = `observe`: declared services intercept `SELECT 1` (allow) and a denied `DELETE` (deny synth); operators see `db_statement` events; `enforce` not yet recommended (unavoidability bundle is Plan 07).

### Plan 05 - `db-plan-05-pg-extended-tx.md`

Spec-§: 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 14; §23.4 steps 6+9.

Deliverables:

- `internal/db/proxy/postgres/statemachine/`: Extended Query state machine including `upstream_dirty_since_sync` (§14.2 with R7 per-Sync-window scope, R17 in-tx Sync guard, R18 pre-deny upstream response forwarding).
- Parse / Bind / Describe / Execute / Sync handling. Classifier sees concrete bound parameters once Bind completes.
- FunctionCall sub-protocol (§7.5) and optional function-call escalation (§7.6).
- SQL-level prepared statements (§7.4) including DEALLOCATE coverage (§9.2 R1 - `discard_plans`, `discard_all`, `discard_temp`, `discard_sequences` covered by `app-allow-safe-session-settings`).
- Transaction state tracking and `deny_mode_in_tx` flows (§14.3, §14.4).
- Approval timeouts inside transactions (§14.5 with R3 default 60s).
- COPY data-frame handling for the duration of `bulk_load` / `bulk_export` operations.

Tests: state-machine table tests; Extended Query happy/sad paths; in-tx deny modes (rollback, idle, error).

External behavior: Extended Query and transactions now correctly enforced.

### Plan 06 - `db-plan-06-cancel-mapping.md`

Spec-§: 15; §23.4 step 8.

Deliverables:

- `BackendKeyData` translation and proxy-wide mapping table (§15.1, §15.3 R21).
- Cancellation flow (§15.2 with R19 sequencing: mapping lookup → connection-rule eval → forward/deny).
- Mapping lifecycle (§15.3 with R2 eviction rule: live mappings never evicted; new connection setup fails with `BACKEND_KEY_TABLE_FULL` if cap is hit and no entry has been past `cancel_grace_window` since disconnect).
- R20 mapping-commit ordering: mapping committed before forwarding `BackendKeyData(syn_pid, syn_secret)` to client.
- §15.5 cancel governance via connection rules; config-load rejection of `decision: approve` on `match_kind: cancel` (R19).

Tests: race tests on commit ordering; eviction/full-table tests; cancel via mapping vs. direct egress (Plan 07 enforces direct-egress block).

External behavior: cancel requests correctly correlated through the proxy.

### Plan 07 - `db-plan-07-unavoidability-integration.md`

Spec-§: 11.1 deploy, 12, 17; §23.4 steps 10+11.

Deliverables:

- `internal/db/listener/` (`//go:build linux`): SO_PEERCRED-based listener authentication (§12.5).
- SessionID-keyed proxy identity exemption (§12.4 R10) using AepCaw's existing ptrace-attach primitive.
- Bypass-attempt event emission (§12.6) with R11 dedup per `(session_id, process_identity, destination_tuple)` within a 60s window.
- Bypass-tool detection bundle (§12.7) covering R22 enumerated tools: `chisel`, `gost`, `frpc`, raw `nc`, `--net=host` containers, custom-compiled tunnels.
- `internal/db/service/bundle.go`: unavoidability bundle generator (§12.3) emitting `dest` rules, network rules, file rules over Unix sockets - all consumed by the existing supervisor.
- Integration test suite using testcontainers: PostgreSQL (full), Aurora-PG (where a testcontainer image is available; otherwise covered by manual cloud test), Redshift (best-effort), CockroachDB. End-to-end golden flows: simple-query allow, deny pre-forward, deny in-tx with rollback, cancel via mapping, COPY bulk_export with redaction, approve with 60s timeout.
- Recommendation flip: `policies.db.unavoidability: enforce` becomes the high-assurance bundle default.

Tests: integration suite; bypass-attempt detection tests; SessionID-keyed identity tests against ptrace-attach.

External behavior: declared DB services become unavoidable for processes inside the AepCaw-governed process tree, per §1's thesis.

## 4. Cross-cutting decisions

These apply to every plan; locking them here avoids per-plan re-litigation.

**Build matrix.** `effects`, `policy`, `events`, `service` build on every platform with no tags. `classify/postgres` builds on every platform via the `Parser` interface - libpg_query on `linux && cgo`, pure-Go fallback elsewhere. `proxy/postgres` and `listener` are `//go:build linux`; non-Linux gets a stub returning `errors.ErrUnsupported`. CI runs `go test ./...` on Linux + macOS and `GOOS=windows go build ./...` on every PR.

**Parser divergence policy.** When the active parser cannot produce an AST, the classifier emits `effects: [{group: unknown}]` with `parser_backend` set to the active backend. §7.8 failure semantics apply: the evaluator's strict-coverage rule means `unknown` is implicitly denied unless an `unknown`-covering rule exists. Pure-Go fallback's documented gaps live in Plan 03's per-plan open-questions section.

**Sample policy as ground truth.** `corpus/sample-policy.yaml`, committed in Plan 02, is the single source of truth for the `expected_decision_under_sample_policy` column in Plan 03's golden corpus. Modifying the sample policy is a Plan 02 change and forces a corpus regen step in Plan 03. CI fails on drift.

**DBEvent emission point.** Events emit from the proxy (Plan 04+), never from the classifier or evaluator. Plans 01-03 produce types and pure functions only. This keeps Plans 01-03 trivially testable and avoids accidental side effects in library code.

**Feature flag.** `policies.db.unavoidability: enforce | observe | off`. Plan 04 introduces the flag with all three values available; the default remains `off`. Operators may opt up to `observe` for early-adopter visibility. Plan 07 makes `enforce` the high-assurance bundle default once integration tests pass.

**Plan-spec rhythm.** Each plan's *implementation* spec is brainstormed when the plan is about to start, not now. This roadmap commits scope and dependencies; per-plan specs commit interfaces and test plans. Plan 01's spec follows immediately after this roadmap is approved.

**Scope discipline.** Phase 2+ items (catalog-aware resolution, statement rewriting, credential broker, MySQL/Mongo/etc.) are not pre-planned here. Each phase gets its own roadmap when it begins.

## 5. Out of scope for this roadmap

- Per-plan implementation specs (these get their own brainstorming pass when started).
- Phase 2+ planning (catalog-aware redirect, credential broker, additional adapters).
- Watchtower-side control-plane work; this roadmap covers AepCaw OSS only.
- Spec changes to `docs/aep-caw-db-access-spec.md` v0.8. The spec is implementation-frozen. If implementation reveals a spec defect, that triggers a redline cycle (the v0.7→v0.8 process), not an inline edit during plan execution.

## 6. Done definition

The roadmap is "done" when Plan 07's integration suite passes and `policies.db.unavoidability: enforce` is the high-assurance bundle default. At that point, Phase 1 is shipped per §2.1 of the source spec.
