# Skill Installation Scanning (`skillcheck`) - Design

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** Draft, awaiting user review
**Related:** `internal/pkgcheck/` (sibling pattern for npm/pip install scanning),
`internal/threatfeed/` (sibling pattern for periodic catalog sync),
`pkg/hotreload/watcher.go` (existing fsnotify-based watcher pattern),
`internal/trash/`, `internal/approval/`, `internal/audit/`.

**Note on file-watching primitive:** The original draft of this spec
referenced `internal/fsmonitor` as the watcher base. That package is a
FUSE-based workspace virtualization layer, not a generic recursive file
watcher - wrong tool for watching `~/.claude/skills/`. The watcher
described below uses `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify` directly, following
the pattern of `pkg/hotreload/watcher.go`.

## Summary

Add a new `internal/skillcheck/` package that intercepts AI agent skill
installations (Claude Code skill directories under `~/.claude/skills/`
and plugin-bundled skills under `~/.claude/plugins/*/skills/`) and
runs them through pluggable security scanners before they become
loadable by the agent.

The architecture mirrors `internal/pkgcheck/`:

- `CheckProvider` interface, `Orchestrator` (parallel fan-out, per-provider
  timeout, `OnFailure: warn|deny|allow`), `Evaluator` (severity → action
  mapping), and four-state `Verdict` (`allow|warn|approve|block`).
- The differences from `pkgcheck` are forced by the artifact: a skill is
  a directory of files (markdown + scripts) rather than a `name@version`,
  and there is no canonical "skill install command" to wrap.

Two trigger paths feed one pipeline:

1. An **fsnotify-based watcher** observes the watch roots for new `SKILL.md`
   landings (covers all install paths: git clone, marketplace plugin,
   manual `cp`).
2. An **`aep-caw skillcheck` CLI** for one-off scans, hook integrations,
   and quarantine management.

Three scanners ship in v1, plus two stubs for v2:

| Provider | Category | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | Offline rule engine | Native Go |
| `snyk` | Active scanner | Subprocess: `uvx snyk-agent-scan@latest --skills <path> --json` |
| `skills_sh` | Provenance signal | HTTP HEAD/GET against `https://skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>/<skill>`; optional `__NEXT_DATA__` parsing for audit badges |
| `chainguard` | (v2) Provenance | Periodic catalog sync - interface only in v1 |
| `repello` | (v2) Active scanner | Stub only in v1 |

The `block` action quarantines the skill directory via `internal/trash`
(reversible soft-delete). The `approve` action prompts via
`internal/approval`. All actions emit `skillcheck.*` audit events.

## Motivation

Malicious AI agent skills are now an established supply-chain attack
vector ([Snyk Labs ClawHavoc analysis][clawhavoc],
[Antiy CERT 1,184 malicious skills on ClawHub][antiy],
[Embrace The Red on hidden Unicode in skills][etr]). Installation
happens through many channels - git clone, marketplace plugins,
manual copies - and once a `SKILL.md` lands in a watched directory it
is loadable by the next agent session. Today aep-caw has no enforcement
layer for this artifact class even though it has a complete pattern
for the analogous npm/pip case (`internal/pkgcheck/`).

This design extends that protection to skills using the same
architectural pattern, the same verdict spectrum, and the same audit
sink, so operators have one mental model for "aep-caw blocked
something dangerous from being installed."

## Non-Goals

- **Web-uploaded skill zips** (claude.ai web app). aep-caw has no
  chokepoint there; that is Repello SkillCheck's product surface, not
  ours. Add later only if we ship a server-side scanner product.
- **MCP server scanning.** Out of scope for this spec; covered (today
  partially) by `internal/mcpinspect/`. A future spec may unify the
  two under a shared interface.
- **Runtime monitoring of skill execution.** This spec covers
  install-time gating only. Runtime enforcement remains a
  seccomp/landlock concern.
- **Repello and Chainguard real integrations.** Stubs only in v1
  because neither exposes a public API today (Snyk acquired Invariant
  but the merged hosted API is "contact us"; Chainguard Agent Skills
  is beta-gated; Repello SkillCheck has only a browser scanner
  publicly).
- **Building or publishing a registry.** We are a consumer, not a
  publisher.

## Trigger Decisions

Two triggers, two reasons:

- **fsnotify watcher on watch roots** catches every install path including
  manual `cp` and `git clone`. Fires on `SKILL.md` landing inside a
  fresh dir under `~/.claude/skills/` or `~/.claude/plugins/*/skills/`.
  Post-write trigger - see "Quarantine" below for the race-window
  argument.
- **`aep-caw skillcheck` CLI** is a fall-through for explicit hook
  integrations (Claude Code `SessionStart`/`PreToolUse`) and manual
  audits.

Both feed the same pipeline. The CLI is also the only way to
quarantine/restore from outside the daemon.

## Artifact Decisions

**Format scope:** Claude Code skill directories only (`SKILL.md` +
supporting files). Plugin-bundled skills are covered transparently
because their on-disk layout is structurally identical to user-installed
skills; the only difference is the watch root.

Web zips and other skill formats are deferred (see Non-Goals).

## Core Types

```go
// SkillRef identifies a single skill on disk.
type SkillRef struct {
    Name     string         // dir name, e.g. "supply-chain-guard"
    Source   string         // "user" | "plugin:<plugin-name>" | "explicit"
    Path     string         // absolute path on disk
    SHA256   string         // hash of canonical file tree (cache key)
    Origin   *GitOrigin     // nil if not a git checkout
    Manifest SkillManifest  // parsed SKILL.md frontmatter
}

type GitOrigin struct {
    URL string // canonical https URL, e.g. "https://github.com/owner/repo"
    Ref string // commit SHA at time of scan
}

type SkillManifest struct {
    Name        string
    Description string
    Allowed     []string // tools/permissions declared in frontmatter
    Source      string   // optional `source:` field, used as fallback for Origin
}

type ScanRequest struct {
    Skill  SkillRef
    Files  map[string][]byte // relative-path -> contents (size-capped)
    Config map[string]string
}

type ScanResponse struct {
    Provider string
    Findings []Finding
    Metadata ResponseMetadata
}

type Finding struct {
    Type     FindingType
    Provider string
    Skill    SkillRef
    Severity Severity
    Title    string
    Detail   string
    Reasons  []Reason
    Links    []string
    Metadata map[string]string
}

type FindingType string

const (
    FindingPromptInjection  FindingType = "prompt_injection"
    FindingExfiltration     FindingType = "exfiltration"
    FindingHiddenUnicode    FindingType = "hidden_unicode"
    FindingMalware          FindingType = "malware"
    FindingPolicyViolation  FindingType = "policy_violation"  // scope mismatch
    FindingCredentialLeak   FindingType = "credential_leak"
    FindingProvenance       FindingType = "provenance"        // positive signal
)

// Severity, Reason, ResponseMetadata, VerdictAction, Verdict, PackageVerdict-equivalent
// (SkillVerdict): identical shape to pkgcheck/types.go; reproduced verbatim except
// PackageRef → SkillRef.
```

`CheckProvider`:

```go
type CheckProvider interface {
    Name() string
    Capabilities() []FindingType
    Scan(ctx context.Context, req ScanRequest) (*ScanResponse, error)
}
```

`ProviderEntry { Provider, Timeout, OnFailure }` and `Orchestrator.ScanAll`
are direct copies of the `pkgcheck` equivalents with `CheckRequest`
renamed to `ScanRequest`.

## Loader

Given a skill directory:

1. Walk the tree depth-first; reject if total size > `total_bytes`
   limit (default 4 MiB) - emit a `policy_violation` finding instead
   of failing the scan.
2. For each file: reject contents above `per_file_bytes` (default
   256 KiB) with the same finding-emission semantics.
3. Read `SKILL.md`; parse YAML/Markdown frontmatter into
   `SkillManifest`.
4. Detect git origin if a `.git/` directory or symlinked repo root is
   present. Read `origin` remote URL and current `HEAD` commit. Fallback
   to `manifest.Source` if no `.git`. Leave `Origin` nil if neither
   resolves.
5. Compute canonical SHA256: sort relative paths, hash
   `len(path) || path || len(content) || content` for each file in
   sequence. Stable across re-clones because it ignores filesystem
   metadata.
6. Return `SkillRef` and the file map for the providers.

## Watcher

Wraps `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify` (already a project dep, used by
`pkg/hotreload/watcher.go`) with two roots:
- `~/.claude/skills/` (literal)
- `~/.claude/plugins/*/skills/` (glob - re-evaluated when a new plugin
  dir is created)

Recursive watching is implemented by `Add`-ing each subdir (fsnotify
doesn't recurse natively on Linux/Windows); the watcher walks each root
on startup and adds new skill dirs as they appear.

Event filtering:
- Only fire on `Create` or `Write` events whose path's basename is
  `SKILL.md`.
- 500ms debounce per skill dir to coalesce git-clone bursts.
- Suppress events whose target skill SHA is in the per-session
  restore-allowlist (set by `restore` command).

Robustness:
- On daemon startup, walk both roots once and enqueue any skill not
  present in the cache (catches installs that happened while daemon
  was down).
- Re-glob plugin path on each new plugin dir creation event.
- Cross-platform: fsnotify supports Linux (inotify), macOS (kqueue/
  FSEvents), Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW).

## Cache

Content-addressed by `SHA256`. Entry stores: per-provider findings,
final verdict, scan timestamp. TTL configurable (default 24h).
Identical pattern to `internal/pkgcheck/cache`.

User-approved skills (from the `approve` verdict path) get a separate
allowlist record keyed by SHA, persisted across daemon restarts, that
short-circuits future scans of the same content.

## Providers

### `local` - built-in offline rule engine

Native Go, always runs, no network. Detects:

| Rule | Severity | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Hidden Unicode (Tag chars U+E0000 - U+E007F, bidi overrides U+202A - U+202E, zero-width joiners) | high | Documented agent-skill attack vector ([Embrace The Red][etr]) |
| Embedded base64 blob > 1 KiB in any file | medium | Often exfil payload; bumped to high if blob decodes to executable bytes |
| Shell snippet that `eval`s an env var or HTTP response | high | Direct RCE pattern |
| Subprocess invocation not declared in `Allowed:` frontmatter | medium | Scope-creep / undeclared capability |
| Prompt-injection markers in skill body (`ignore previous instructions`, `<system>`, etc.) | medium | OWASP Agentic Top 10 signal |
| `Allowed:` declares `read-only` but body contains `rm`, `curl -X POST`, etc. | high | Permission-scope mismatch |

`Capabilities()` returns all rule types.
`OnFailure: deny` (default) - local should never fail; if it does,
fail closed.

### `snyk` - subprocess wrapper

Resolution order at startup and on each scan:
1. `config.providers.snyk.binary_path` (explicit override)
2. `snyk-agent-scan` on `PATH`
3. `uvx snyk-agent-scan@latest` (if `uvx` is on `PATH`)

If none resolve **and** the provider is enabled:
- Emit one `skillcheck.provider_unavailable` audit event at daemon
  startup (deduped across the session).
- Each scan returns `ScanResponse{ Metadata: { Error: "snyk: no
  executable found" } }`. The orchestrator's `OnFailure` handles the
  rest (recommended default `OnFailure: warn` for snyk).
- `aep-caw skillcheck doctor` reports the failure with remediation
  text ("install uvx via `pipx install uv`, or run `pipx install
  snyk-agent-scan` and set `providers.snyk.binary_path`").

Invocation: `<resolved> --skills <skill-dir> --json` with
`ProviderEntry.Timeout` (default 60s - uvx cold-start is slow).

JSON parsing: version-tolerant. Unknown fields → ignored. Required
fields missing → `Metadata.Partial: true` plus a single
`Reason{ Code: "snyk_schema_drift" }`. Pin the schema at first
bring-up by running the tool once and committing the observed envelope
shape into the parser.

### `skills_sh` - provenance lookup

Two modes, controlled by `providers.skills_sh.probe_audits`:

**Default mode (provenance only):**
1. Skip if `SkillRef.Origin == nil` - `Capabilities()` returns `[]`
   for that scan.
2. From `Origin.URL`, derive the skills.sh canonical URL:
   `https://skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>/<skill-name>`.
3. HTTP HEAD with timeout (default 10s).
4. `200 OK` → emit `Finding{ Type: provenance, Severity: info,
   Title: "Registered on skills.sh", Reasons: [{Code: "skills_sh_registered"}] }`.
5. `404` → no finding (neutral signal).
6. Other status / error → `Metadata.Error` set; `OnFailure: allow` by
   default (missing provenance is not itself a finding).

**Probe-audits mode (opt-in):**
- HTTP GET instead of HEAD.
- Parse the `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">` tag (standard Next.js
  embed) for the audit-result props (Snyk, Socket, Gen Agent Trust
  Hub pass/fail).
- Emit one `provenance` finding per audit, severity = info on pass,
  high on fail. (Still positive findings - interpretation is in the
  evaluator.)
- If `__NEXT_DATA__` is missing or malformed → degrade silently to
  default-mode behavior; emit an audit event
  `skillcheck.skills_sh_probe_failed` (deduped per skill).

### `chainguard` (v2 stub)

File exists with `CheckProvider` interface implemented:
```go
func (p *chainguardProvider) Capabilities() []FindingType { return nil }
func (p *chainguardProvider) Scan(ctx context.Context, req ScanRequest) (*ScanResponse, error) {
    return &ScanResponse{
        Provider: p.Name(),
        Metadata: ResponseMetadata{ Error: "chainguard: not yet implemented (beta access pending)" },
    }, nil
}
```
Config gates it `enabled: false` by default. Single test asserts the
documented response. When Chainguard publishes the catalog format,
implement a `internal/skillcheck/chainguard/syncer.go` (mirror
`internal/threatfeed/syncer.go`) and replace the stub.

### `repello` (v2 stub)

Identical structure to the chainguard stub. Replace when Repello
publishes documented REST API.

## Evaluator

```
findings → group by skill →
  1. base = max(severity of all non-provenance findings)
  2. provenance adjustment:
       all skills_sh audits pass        → -1 step
       any skills_sh audit fail         → +1 step
       not registered (or HEAD-only)    → no change
  3. severity → action via configured threshold table:
       info     → allow
       low      → allow (configurable warn)
       medium   → warn
       high     → approve
       critical → block
```

Threshold table is fully configurable per `pkgcheck` precedent.

## Action Layer

| Verdict | Action |
|---|---|
| `allow` | No-op |
| `warn` | Emit `skillcheck.scan_completed` audit event with the warn verdict |
| `approve` | Block on `internal/approval` prompt; on deny → `block`; on approve → cache the SHA in user-approved allowlist (skip future re-scans of identical content) |
| `block` | `trash.Move(skillDir, reason)` via `internal/trash`; emit `skillcheck.quarantined` with trash record ID |

Race window note: fsmonitor is post-write, so a malicious skill
could be loaded by a concurrently-running Claude session in the
narrow window between `SKILL.md` landing and quarantine completing.
This is acceptable because:
1. Quarantine still removes the skill before any *future* session loads
   it.
2. Most installs happen between sessions (`git clone`, then start
   Claude).
3. The alternative - pre-write blocking - would require wrapping every
   possible install command, which is intractable for this artifact
   class (unlike npm/pip where a single binary is the chokepoint).

The design accepts this trade-off and documents it.

## CLI Surface

```
aep-caw skillcheck scan <path>          # one-off scan, prints verdict
aep-caw skillcheck scan --all           # walk both watch roots
aep-caw skillcheck list-quarantined     # show quarantined skills
aep-caw skillcheck restore <skill-name> # restore from trash + add to
                                        # restore-allowlist for the
                                        # next watcher event
aep-caw skillcheck doctor               # provider availability report
aep-caw skillcheck cache prune          # clear cache
```

`scan` and `scan --all` exit non-zero on `block` (for hook
integrations: a Claude Code `SessionStart` hook can call
`aep-caw skillcheck scan --all` and abort startup if any skill is
blocked).

## Audit Events

New event family `skillcheck.*` in `internal/audit`:

| Event | Fields |
|---|---|
| `skillcheck.scan_started` | skill_ref, providers_selected |
| `skillcheck.scan_completed` | skill_ref, findings[], verdict |
| `skillcheck.provider_unavailable` | provider, reason (deduped per startup) |
| `skillcheck.quarantined` | skill_ref, verdict, trash_record_id |
| `skillcheck.restored` | skill_ref, trash_record_id |
| `skillcheck.user_approved` | skill_ref, sha, user_id |
| `skillcheck.skills_sh_probe_failed` | skill_ref, reason (deduped per skill) |

Routed through the existing audit sink alongside `pkgcheck.*` events.

## Configuration

```yaml
skillcheck:
  enabled: true
  watch_roots:
    - ~/.claude/skills
    - ~/.claude/plugins/*/skills
  scan_size_limits:
    per_file_bytes: 262144      # 256 KiB
    total_bytes: 4194304        # 4 MiB
  thresholds:
    low: allow
    medium: warn
    high: approve
    critical: block
  cache:
    ttl: 24h
  providers:
    local:
      enabled: true
      timeout: 5s
      on_failure: deny
    snyk:
      enabled: true
      timeout: 60s
      on_failure: warn
      binary_path: ""           # empty → auto-resolve via uvx/PATH
    skills_sh:
      enabled: true
      timeout: 10s
      on_failure: allow         # missing provenance is not a finding
      probe_audits: false       # opt-in __NEXT_DATA__ parsing
    chainguard:
      enabled: false            # v2 stub
    repello:
      enabled: false            # v2 stub
```

## Testing Strategy

| Component | Tests |
|---|---|
| `local` | Table-driven per rule (positive + negative). Golden fixtures in `testdata/skills/` covering OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 patterns. |
| `snyk` | Fake CLI binary fixture (`testdata/snyk-agent-scan-fake`) emitting canned JSON. Cases: success, schema drift (unknown fields), exit-code variants, timeout, binary-not-found alert path, all three resolution branches. |
| `skills_sh` | `httptest.NewServer` returning canned responses. Cases: 200/404, malformed HTML, missing `__NEXT_DATA__`, timeout, audit-badge state matrix. |
| `chainguard` / `repello` stubs | Single test confirming "not yet implemented" response. |
| `loader` | Fixtures for: minimal valid skill, oversized skill, deep dir tree, broken frontmatter, git-cloned skill (origin detection), non-git skill, skill with `source:` frontmatter fallback. |
| `watcher` | Synthetic fsnotify events via in-process channel (or a temp dir + real fsnotify writes). Cases: skill landing, partial-write coalescing, plugin glob expansion, restore-allowlist suppression, daemon-startup catch-up. |
| `evaluator` | Table-driven over `(severity, provenance)` matrix → expected action. |
| `orchestrator` | Reuse `pkgcheck` test patterns. |
| `cache` | Reuse `pkgcheck/cache` test patterns. |
| `action` | Mock `trash` and `approval`; assert correct dispatch + audit events per verdict. |
| Integration | Drop a malicious fixture skill into a temp watch root; assert `quarantined` audit + skill removed + restore round-trip + no re-quarantine after restore. |

Cross-platform: per `CLAUDE.md`, verify `GOOS=windows go build ./...`
succeeds. `fsnotify` is cross-platform; no new platform-specific code
expected.

## Open Questions / Future Work

- **Snyk hosted API.** Reach out to Snyk for the merged
  Snyk+Invariant hosted API (post-acquisition). When granted, swap the
  subprocess adapter for an HTTP one without touching the rest of the
  system.
- **Chainguard beta access.** Request beta access in parallel with v1
  shipping. Replace the stub when the catalog format is published.
- **Repello REST API.** Same - request access; replace stub.
- **`npx skills` CLI subprocess mode for skills_sh.** If/when the
  Vercel CLI exposes a non-mutating `inspect` or `audit` query
  command, add a third skills.sh mode (subprocess) parallel to the
  Snyk integration. Until then, HEAD-only and `__NEXT_DATA__`
  parsing are the only verified paths.
- **Unify with `internal/mcpinspect/`.** A future spec may extract a
  shared interface for "agent component scanner" covering both skills
  and MCP servers.
