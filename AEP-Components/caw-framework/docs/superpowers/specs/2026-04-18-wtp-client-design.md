# Watchtower Transport Protocol (WTP) Client Design

**Date:** 2026-04-18
**Status:** Draft
**Spec:** AepCaw → Watchtower Transport Protocol v0.4.9-draft
**Scope:** Phase 2 only - client library (no server, no OCSF mapper, no composite refactor)
**Related:**
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-phase-0-shared-sequence-contract.md` (sequence/generation contract)
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-30-wire-hmac-integrity-chain-design.md` (existing chain wiring)
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-11-hmac-chain-tamper-evidence-design.md` (sidecar, recovery)
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-13-deferred-sync-audit-write-design.md` (deferred-sync model reused for WAL)

## Problem

AepCaw today persists audit events to local sinks: SQLite (queryable, optional), JSONL (durable, append-only), OTEL (export to collector), and webhook (HTTP push). For Watchtower - the agentic-fleet console - we need a fifth sink that ships events over a long-lived gRPC connection with the WTP wire protocol: TLS 1.3, OCSF-aligned `CompactEvent`, HMAC chain with sink-local hashes over a shared sequence, WAL-backed at-least-once delivery, batching, compression, reconnect with replay, and `TransportLoss` markers when the WAL must drop records.

This design covers the **client library only**. The server side, the OCSF schema mapper (Phase 1), and the composite-store sequence refactor (Phase 0) are prerequisites whose contracts are documented but whose implementation is not part of this work.

## Goals

- New sink `internal/store/watchtower/` implementing `store.EventStore`.
- Faithful implementation of WTP v0.4.9 §6 (integrity), §7 (wire format), §8 (transport), §10 (config).
- Survives network failures, server restarts, segment loss, and process crashes without corrupting the integrity chain or losing events that were durably accepted.
- Cross-platform Go build (Linux/macOS/Windows). No CGo dependencies.
- Testable end-to-end with an in-tree `bufconn`-based test server that simulates drops, GOAWAYs, ack delays, and stale watermarks - no external Watchtower instance required to run the test suite.

## Non-Goals

- Server implementation (Watchtower).
- OCSF schema mapper (Phase 1) - assumed available via a `Mapper` interface that this client consumes.
- Composite-store refactor to advance a shared sequence/generation before fanout (Phase 0) - assumed; this client reads the contract via well-known `ev.Fields` keys.
- Live key rotation while connected (deferred Open Question).
- mTLS automation / SPIFFE / cert rotation hooks beyond reading static cert/key files (deferred).
- HTTP/2 fallback transport (deferred).
- Multi-tenant routing.

## Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Phase 2 only (client library) | Server is owned by another team; Phase 0 (composite refactor) and Phase 1 (OCSF mapper) are prerequisites. Client can be built and tested in isolation given a contract for both. |
| **Architecture** | Layered sub-packages under `internal/store/watchtower/` | Each layer has one responsibility (chain, compact, wal, transport) and can be unit-tested without the others. Wire types live in a separate `proto/canyonroad/wtp/v1/` tree to be regeneratable. |
| **WAL framing** | 4-byte length + 4-byte CRC32C-Castagnoli + protobuf record bytes; 16-byte segment header (WTP1 magic, version, flags, generation) | CRC32C catches segment corruption (truncated tail, bit-flips). Castagnoli has hardware acceleration on x86 and arm64. Length prefix allows streaming reads without protobuf parse. |
| **Concurrency model** | WAL is the queue; one transport goroutine drives a `select{}` state machine; small recv-goroutine reads ACKs from the gRPC stream | `AppendEvent` never blocks on network - it returns as soon as the WAL fsync completes (or fast path: page cache + background sync, matching `2026-04-13-deferred-sync`). The transport goroutine owns all session/connection state, eliminating lock contention. |
| **Backpressure** | WAL bounded by `max_total_bytes`; overflow → drop oldest unacked + emit `TransportLoss` marker | Matches spec §8.5. AppendEvent never fails due to a slow server. Loss is observable to the operator and to the server (gap in sequences). |
| **Testing** | In-tree `testserver` package using `bufconn`; scenario hooks for Drop/Goaway/AckDelay/stale watermark | Hermetic, fast, deterministic. Integration tests against real Watchtower instances are out of scope for this work. |
| **Open questions** | Defer all three (key rotation pause/resume, OCSF version negotiation, sub-second timestamp granularity) | Spec is explicit they are unresolved. Each gets a code comment marking the integration point so a follow-up PR can wire them in without restructuring. |

### Layer responsibilities

| Package | Responsibility | Touches network? | Touches disk? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `watchtower` (root) | Implements `store.EventStore`, owns lifecycle (Start/Close), wires the others together. | No directly | No directly |
| `chain` | Pure: advance a sink-local entry hash from `(seq, gen, prev_hash, canonical_record)`. Computes context digest. | No | No |
| `compact` | Pure: project an `events.Event` into a `CompactEvent` (OCSF class + activity + payload). | No | No |
| `wal` | Append+fsync records, seal+roll segments, replay records on startup, GC after ack. | No | Yes |
| `transport` | One goroutine state machine: dial, SessionInit, send batches, replay on reconnect, heartbeat. | Yes | No |
| `testserver` | bufconn stub of the WTP server; scriptable scenarios. | In-process only | No |

The root `store.go` is small (~150 lines): it constructs a `Config`, builds the `chain`, opens the `wal`, starts the `transport`, and forwards `AppendEvent` calls. Everything else is delegated.

## Data Flow

### Steady state - `AppendEvent` (transactional pattern)

```
caller (composite store)
  │  composite has already allocated (seq, gen) and stamped ev.Chain
  │  via the typed pkg/types.Event.Chain *ChainState field (Phase 0).
  ▼
watchtower.Store.AppendEvent(ctx, ev)
  │
  │ 1. validate: ev.Chain != nil, else propagate compact.ErrMissingChain
  │      (wrapped as `watchtower: %w` from compact.Encode; loud failure
  │      because composite-store regressions must surface to the caller).
  │      Note: although the upstream Phase 0 contract documents the
  │      composite-store side as `audit.ErrMissingChainState`, the WTP
  │      sink boundary surfaces `compact.ErrMissingChain` because the
  │      check is performed inside `compact.Encode` against the typed
  │      `ev.Chain == nil` predicate (composite stamps `ev.Chain` rather
  │      than returning an error). `compact.Encode` performs `errors.Is`
  │      against `compact.ErrMissingChain` only - it does not consult
  │      `audit.ErrMissingChainState`. The two sentinels intentionally
  │      live in separate packages: audit owns the composite-store
  │      contract; compact owns the per-sink encode boundary.
  │
  │ 2. compact.Encode(ev) → wtpv1.CompactEvent
  │
  │ 3. canonicalize → bytes for hashing
  │
  │ 4. SinkChain.Compute(formatVersion, seq, gen, payload)
  │      → *ComputeResult (opaque, chain-bound; EntryHash() and
  │        PrevHash() accessors expose values for serialization;
  │        sequence, generation, chain pointer tracked internally for
  │        Commit-time validation)
  │        PURE, no chain mutation
  │
  │ 5. wal.Append(seq, gen, record_bytes)
  │      → (a) clean failure: return err, no Commit, chain unchanged
  │      → (b) ambiguous failure: SinkChain.Fatal(err); return ErrFatalIntegrity
  │      → (c) success: continue
  │
  │ 6. SinkChain.Commit(result) - chain advances; non-nil error means the
  │      chain just latched fatal (backwards generation, stale token, or
  │      rollover-with-nonempty-prev) and must be surfaced
  │
  │ 7. transport.Notify() → wake transport goroutine (non-blocking)
  │
  └─ return nil
```

The WTP `AppendEvent` follows the transactional Compute → durable-write → Commit pattern from §"Sink integration" of the Phase 0 contract. Failure modes:

| WAL failure | Action | Chain state | Caller-visible error |
|---|---|---|---|
| Clean (e.g., overflow detected before any I/O, validation error) | No Commit. Caller may retry. | Unchanged. | The clean error. |
| Ambiguous (write returned, fsync returned, partial write possible) | `SinkChain.Fatal(err)`. Subsequent appends return `ErrFatalIntegrity`. | Latched fatal. | The ambiguous error wrapped in `FatalIntegrityError`. |
| Success | `Commit`. | `prev_hash := entry_hash`, `generation := ev.Chain.Generation`. | nil. |

The `wal.Append` function is the only place that classifies WAL failures into clean vs ambiguous. The classification is documented in §4 below.

                         (back to connecting)
```

### Generation roll (WAL-driven, not transport-driven)

Generation boundaries are detected and enforced inside `wal.Append`, *before* the record is written. This is the only place that can guarantee "single generation per segment" because the WAL writes records to the segment file before the transport ever sees them.

```
wal.Append(seq, gen, payload):
  if gen != currentSegment.generation:
    seal currentSegment (rename .INPROGRESS → .seg, fsync parent)
    open new segment with header.generation = gen
    fsync new segment header
    enqueue an internal "GENERATION_ROLL" notification record so the
      transport knows to flush the current batch and emit SessionUpdate
      before sending the first record of the new generation.
  write framed record into currentSegment
  fsync per policy
```

The transport, on observing the GENERATION_ROLL notification in the WAL stream, performs the protocol-level work (flush current batch, send `SessionUpdate` with new context digest, then begin batching new-generation records). The chain itself resets per-sink: `SinkChain.Compute` automatically uses `prev_hash = ""` when it sees a new generation, and `Commit` records the new generation.

### WAL overflow → TransportLoss

When `wal.Append` would push total disk usage past `max_total_bytes`:
1. Drop the oldest *unacked* segment(s) until under budget.
2. Emit a synthetic `TransportLoss{from_seq, to_seq, dropped_count, generation}` record into the WAL.
3. Increment `wtp_transport_loss_total`.
4. The marker is sent like any other batch when the transport reaches it; the server learns about the gap via the marker, not via a missing sequence number alone.

CRC-corruption recovery emits `TransportLoss` with a *coarse* range: when a record fails CRC verification on read, we report `TransportLoss{from_seq: last_good_seq + 1, to_seq: segment_max_seq_estimate, generation: segment.generation}`. The estimate is computed as `last_good_seq + (segment_remaining_bytes / typical_record_size)`. This is best-effort but bounded: corruption in practice almost always means a truncated tail, where the gap extends to the segment end. A v2 enhancement (per-record sequence in the frame header, +8 bytes/record) would enable exact gap reporting; deferred until operators report imprecise ranges in practice.

## Phase 0 Contract (consumed, not implemented)

The composite store allocates a shared `(sequence, generation)` *once* via a `audit.SequenceAllocator` and stamps it onto the typed `ev.Chain *types.ChainState` field *before* fanning the event out to sinks. The WTP client reads it via:

```go
if ev.Chain == nil {
    return audit.ErrMissingChainState  // composite did not stamp
}
seq := ev.Chain.Sequence    // uint64
gen := ev.Chain.Generation  // uint32
```

The field is `json:"-"` on `pkg/types.Event` - it cannot leak into JSONL, OTEL, or any other JSON-based serializer. Per-sink hashing is the responsibility of each sink's own `audit.SinkChain` instance, using the shared `(seq, gen)` from `ev.Chain`.

The full contract - `SequenceAllocator` + `SinkChain` types, the transactional Compute/Commit protocol, generation semantics, `TransportLoss` semantics on the shared sequence, and the `types.Event.Chain` field - is documented in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-phase-0-shared-sequence-contract.md`. That doc is the source of truth; this design depends on it but does not change it.

## Chain Package (`internal/store/watchtower/chain`)

The WTP sink uses `audit.SinkChain` from the Phase 0 contract directly - there is no WTP-specific chain wrapper. This package contains only the helpers `audit.SinkChain` does not provide: canonical-record encoding (the byte-exact format that gets hashed) and the WTP-specific context digest.

### Helpers (not a new chain type)

```go
package chain

// IntegrityRecord is the WTP-specific structure that gets canonical-encoded
// and passed as the payload to audit.SinkChain.Compute. The on-the-wire
// integrity_record JSON object in WTP CompactEvent has these fields.
type IntegrityRecord struct {
    FormatVersion  uint32   // = 2 (spec §6.4); bump on any canonical-encoding or field-set change
    Sequence       uint64   // shared, from ev.Chain.Sequence; layered contract - see note below
    Generation     uint32   // shared, from ev.Chain.Generation
    PrevHash       string   // sink-local; provided by audit.SinkChain
    EventHash      string   // sha256(canonical_compact_event_bytes)
    ContextDigest  string   // bound at SessionInit/Update/rotation
    KeyFingerprint string
}

// EncodeCanonical produces the byte-exact JSON encoding mandated by spec §6.4
// (sorted keys, no insignificant whitespace, ASCII-escaped non-ASCII, decimal
// numbers). This output is the payload passed to audit.SinkChain.Compute and
// is the contract surface for cross-implementation parity.
func EncodeCanonical(rec IntegrityRecord) ([]byte, error)

// ComputeContextDigest returns the SHA-256 of the canonical encoding of the
// SessionContext fields the spec lists. Bound into every event hash in the
// session/segment. Returns ErrInvalidUTF8 if any string field contains
// invalid UTF-8 (see "Canonical encoding" subsection for rationale).
func ComputeContextDigest(ctx SessionContext) (string, error)

// ComputeEventHash returns sha256(canonical_compact_event_bytes). Used to
// populate IntegrityRecord.EventHash before passing the canonical-encoded
// IntegrityRecord to audit.SinkChain.Compute.
func ComputeEventHash(canonicalEvent []byte) string
```

The actual chain mutations (Compute/Commit/Fatal/State/Restore) all live on `audit.SinkChain`; we do not re-implement them. The transactional pattern from §"Steady state" calls into `audit.SinkChain` directly.

#### Sequence-width layered contract

The sequence value participates in three different width contracts as it flows through the system, and each layer has a different range:

| Layer | Type | Range |
|---|---|---|
| WTP wire format (`CompactEvent.sequence`, `IntegrityRecord.sequence`, this struct) | `uint64` | full uint64 |
| Phase 0 audit chain (`audit.SinkChain.Compute(formatVersion int, sequence int64, ...)`) | `int64` | 0..math.MaxInt64 |
| Composite-store source (`ev.Chain.Sequence`, `pkg/types.ChainState`) | `uint64` | 0..math.MaxInt64 (constrained by Phase 0 spec) |

The constraint surfaces at one place: `watchtower.Store.AppendEvent` (Task 23, Phase 10) bounds-checks `ev.Chain.Sequence <= math.MaxInt64` before converting to int64 and calling into the chain. Sequences exceeding the cap are dropped (counter `wtp_dropped_sequence_overflow_total`, structured log) **before WAL admission** - no segment write, no WAL accounting impact, no replay considerations. Drops do NOT crash or panic. The encoder in `chain/canonical.go` accepts the full uint64 range so wire-format conformance vectors can exercise it; constraint enforcement is the boundary's job.

The same boundary handles `chain.ErrInvalidUTF8` for **per-record encodes only** - i.e., the SinkChain.Compute call inside AppendEvent that wraps EncodeCanonical for the current event's IntegrityRecord. Drop semantics: counter `wtp_dropped_invalid_utf8_total`, structured log, no WAL admission, no chain advance (the SinkChain Compute call returns the error before mutating prev_hash). The drop leaves a sequence gap visible to the server, since other sinks (JSONL, OTEL) have already committed the allocated sequence - whether to surface that gap as a `TransportLoss` marker (and with what reason code) is deferred to Phase 8 when the per-sink batching layer lands.

Session-lifecycle ErrInvalidUTF8 (`ComputeContextDigest` failing at SessionInit, SessionUpdate, or chain rotation) follows a different contract - see "Context digest" below - because no shared sequence has been allocated yet, so there is no gap to manage.

### Canonical encoding - non-negotiable byte parity

Spec §6.4 mandates a canonical JSON encoding with sorted keys, no insignificant whitespace, ASCII-escaped non-ASCII, and decimal numbers (no scientific notation). `encoding/json` does *not* guarantee any of these invariants across versions, and a single byte difference breaks every other implementation's verification.

Invalid UTF-8 in any string field is **rejected** with `ErrInvalidUTF8`, not silently replaced with U+FFFD. Substitution would produce different canonical bytes (and therefore different SHA-256 hashes) for the same input depending on which language's encoder ran - the worst kind of cross-implementation drift, since both sides would be "valid". Callers MUST handle `ErrInvalidUTF8` as a record-level drop with a counter increment, not a session-level abort.

We hand-roll the encoder in `chain/canonical.go`:

```go
func EncodeCanonical(rec IntegrityRecord) ([]byte, error)
```

The encoder is exhaustively tested against `chain/testdata/vectors.json`, which is also published as the cross-implementation conformance suite for the spec. Vectors include UTF-8 edge cases (escaped non-ASCII, surrogate pairs), large numbers near uint64 max, and empty strings.

**Negative vectors.** Invalid UTF-8 cannot be expressed as a JSON string, so negative cases use a different schema: `{"name", "kind", "input": {<other fields>}, "input_b64": "<base64-encoded raw bytes>", "input_field": "<canonical wire field name>", "expected_error": "ErrInvalidUTF8"}`.

The `input_field` value is the **canonical wire/JSON field name** (snake_case), NOT the language-specific struct field name. Valid values for `kind: "integrity_record"` are `prev_hash`, `event_hash`, `context_digest`, `key_fingerprint`. Valid values for `kind: "context_digest"` are `session_id`, `agent_id`, `agent_version`, `ocsf_version`, `algorithm`, `key_fingerprint`. Each implementation maps these to its local struct field names inside its test harness; the published vectors stay language-neutral.

The test harness applies the decoded bytes to the named field after parsing the rest of `input` normally. Cross-language implementations MUST implement the `input_b64` schema to claim WTP-spec-conformance - the negative cases are part of the contract surface, not optional. As a temporary fallback during initial bring-up, an implementation MAY skip negative entries and substitute per-language unit tests; once the implementation reaches "WTP-conformant" status, the negative vectors must be honored end-to-end.

**Raw-byte injection is mandatory harness behavior.** Negative vectors carry intentionally-invalid byte sequences via the `input_b64` + `input_field` channel rather than embedding raw bytes in the JSON `input` object, because most JSON parsers either reject or silently transcode non-UTF-8 strings. Every conforming harness MUST implement this side-channel injection: decode `input_b64` as base64, then write the resulting bytes (without any UTF-8 validation or transcoding) into the local struct field named by `input_field`. Skipping or "sanitizing" this step would mask exactly the failure mode these vectors test.

Positive-vector `input` objects also use the canonical snake_case wire keys (e.g., `format_version`, `sequence`, `session_id`); each implementation maps these to its local struct fields inside its test harness. The vectors are language-neutral - they reference the wire format, never any implementation's internal naming.

**Lossless integer parsing.** Conformance harnesses MUST parse `sequence`, `format_version`, and `generation` JSON numbers losslessly. Implementations whose default JSON parser does not preserve full uint64 precision (notably JavaScript / TypeScript using `JSON.parse`, which materializes numeric tokens as IEEE-754 `Number` before any reviver runs and so cannot recover precision after the fact) MUST use a BigInt-aware parser library (e.g., `json-bigint`, `lossless-json`) or a streaming/tokenizing parser that exposes raw numeric lexemes before numeric coercion. Validating against the `uint64_max_sequence` vector is the canonical gate for this requirement.

**Duplicate-key policy.** Conformance vector files MUST NOT contain duplicate JSON keys at any nesting level. This is a **review-time discipline** for the published file - the Go reference harness uses `encoding/json` with `DisallowUnknownFields`, which rejects unknown keys but accepts duplicate keys with last-value-wins semantics. Cross-language harnesses SHOULD use a strict parser that rejects duplicates where the standard library exposes one (e.g., Python `json.loads(..., object_pairs_hook=...)`). A future revision of this spec may introduce a CI-level vectors lint that rejects duplicate keys at publication time; until then, treat the policy as a normative requirement on the file, not as something the reference harness mechanically enforces at load time.

**Vector schema versioning.** The `input_field` + `input_b64` schema and the snake_case `input` keys are the **v1** published conformance vector format. Pre-v1 (Go-shaped) vectors were never published to external consumers; this is a pre-release tightening, not a migration. The v1 schema is the contract from this point forward.

**v1 (current) file shape:** the file is a bare JSON array of vector objects.

**v2+ (future) file shape:** the file is an object: `{"schema_version": 2, "vectors": [ ... ]}`. Future versions follow the same envelope; only `schema_version` changes.

**Detection rule:** if the top-level JSON value is an array, the harness MUST treat it as v1 (no `schema_version` field is present or expected). If the top-level value is an object, the harness MUST read `schema_version`. Any value the harness does not recognize MUST be rejected - the harness MUST refuse to load the file with a clear error (fail-closed). This prevents a future incompatible vector set from being silently treated as conformant.

**Compatibility:** when v2 ships, v1 must keep working alongside it for at least one minor release. New harness implementations supporting only v2 are not WTP-conformant until they also accept v1.

**Unknown-field policy.** Both the v1 (bare-array) and v2+ (envelope) loader paths reject unknown fields - at the envelope level (`schema_version`, `vectors` are the only accepted keys) and at the per-entry level (every key on a `vectorEntry` must be one the harness recognizes). Implementations MUST configure their JSON decoder to fail on unknown fields (e.g., `dec.DisallowUnknownFields()` in Go) on every decode in the loader so that typos and forward-incompatible vectors fail loudly rather than being silently dropped. This complements the strict envelope `schema_version` check above with the same fail-closed posture at the entry level.

**Trailing content.** The loader MUST treat any non-whitespace content after the top-level JSON value (array or envelope) as a parse error. Both paths enforce this - `json.Unmarshal` natively rejects trailing data, and the envelope path additionally checks `dec.Decode(&struct{}{})` returns `io.EOF` after the envelope. This catches accidental concatenation and forward-incompatible streaming formats.

#### Canonical-format versioning

`IntegrityRecord.FormatVersion` is the canonical-encoding version. Any of the following changes MUST bump it in the same commit:

- Adding, removing, or renaming a field in `IntegrityRecord` or `SessionContext`.
- Changing the canonical key order (currently lexicographic), the whitespace policy (currently none), the number format (currently decimal-only), or the string-escape policy (currently lowercase \uXXXX with surrogate pairs for non-BMP, invalid UTF-8 rejected).
- Changing `ComputeContextDigest`'s field set or encoding rules.

The version is consumed by verifiers to pick the right canonical-encoder and reject older/newer records they do not understand. Version-mixed chains are not supported.

### Context digest (§6.4.6)

```go
func ComputeContextDigest(ctx SessionContext) (string, error)
```

Computed once on `SessionInit`, again on `SessionUpdate`, and again on chain rotation. Bound into every event hash in that segment. Implemented as SHA-256 of the canonical encoding of the SessionContext fields the spec lists.

Callers MUST handle the error path. Unlike per-record `EncodeCanonical` failures (which drop one event and continue - see "Sequence-width layered contract" above), `ComputeContextDigest` failures abort the lifecycle operation that triggered them:

- **SessionInit**: connect attempt fails fast, no session is established, the agent surfaces a fatal config error (counter `wtp_session_init_failures_total{reason="invalid_utf8"}`, structured log with the offending field name from the wrapped error). The transport does NOT auto-retry - invalid identifiers come from agent config and won't fix themselves.
- **SessionUpdate / chain rotation**: rotation aborts, the existing chain stays bound to the prior context, and the operator gets a structured warn log (counter `wtp_session_rotation_failures_total{reason="invalid_utf8"}`). The session continues with the old context until the operator either fixes the identifier or restarts the agent.

Both cases use the wrapped error text from `ErrInvalidUTF8` (which contains the offending field name in its message) for diagnostics - see Metrics section for the exact log shape.

### What this package does NOT do

- Advance the shared sequence (composite owns the `audit.SequenceAllocator`).
- Mutate `prev_hash` (lives on `audit.SinkChain`).
- Persist any state (root `store.go` reconstructs `audit.SinkChain` from WAL on startup via `Restore`).
- Talk to the network or to a KMS (the key is passed in already-resolved at construction).

## WAL Package (`internal/store/watchtower/wal`)

### Directory layout

```
$state_dir/wtp/
  meta.json                      // atomic temp+rename, fsync(parent)
  segments/
    0000000000.seg.INPROGRESS    // currently being written
    0000000001.seg                // sealed
    0000000002.seg                // sealed
    …
```

### Segment header (16 bytes)

```
offset  size  field
0       4     magic     = "WTP1"
4       2     version   = 1
6       2     flags     (bit 0: gen_init, others reserved 0)
8       4     generation
12      4     reserved
```

Header is fsync'd at segment creation. A reader rejects segments with unknown magic, unknown version, or non-zero reserved bits.

### Record framing (per record)

```
offset  size      field
0       4         length     (uint32 BE; bytes after this field, excluding the CRC and including payload)
4       4         crc32c     (Castagnoli, computed over payload)
8       length-4  payload    (protobuf-encoded WAL record; carries seq + gen)
```

Sequence and generation are encoded inside the protobuf payload (not in the frame header), so a per-record scan after CRC failure can recover them when the record itself parses cleanly. When CRC fails, the record bytes are unsafe to parse - the recovery path below uses the segment header's generation and the last-good record's sequence to bound the lost range.

The CRC is the last line of defense against truncated tails (crash mid-fsync). Reader behaviour on bad CRC: log + emit `TransportLoss` marker with a coarse range (see "CRC corruption recovery" below) + skip to next valid record.

### `Append` - clean vs ambiguous failure classification

`wal.Append` is the only place that decides whether a write failure is recoverable. The classification feeds directly into the WTP `AppendEvent` transactional pattern (clean → no Commit, ambiguous → Fatal).

```go
func (w *WAL) Append(seq int64, gen uint32, payload []byte) (AppendResult, error)

type AppendResult struct {
    GenerationRolled bool   // true iff this Append rolled the segment for a new generation
}
```

Failure classification:

| Failure source | Classification | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `payload` exceeds segment-size budget | Clean | Validated before any I/O. |
| WAL is in `closed` state | Clean | Validated before any I/O. |
| `MaxTotalBytes` exceeded after attempting overflow GC | Clean (loss marker emitted instead of returning error) | We drop oldest segments and emit `TransportLoss`. The Append itself succeeds. |
| `os.Write` returns short write or io error | Ambiguous | Bytes may have hit the filesystem buffer or the platter. |
| `f.Sync()` returns error | Ambiguous | Sync may have partially flushed. |
| Segment-roll rename fails after seal | Ambiguous | Old segment may or may not have been removed; new segment may or may not exist. |
| `meta.json` atomic-rename fails on watermark update (on Ack path, not Append) | Ambiguous | meta.json may be in either old or new state. |

A clean failure leaves the WAL in a consistent state: the partial frame (if any) is truncated back to the last good byte, the segment file's logical size is restored, and `Append` returns the error. The caller (WTP `AppendEvent`) does NOT call `SinkChain.Commit`, so the chain stays at the previous `prev_hash` and the next event hashes against the same prev_hash. If the caller retries with a new event allocation, the `(seq, gen)` differs but `prev_hash` is unchanged - which is correct, because the failed event was never durably persisted.

An ambiguous failure latches the WAL in `degraded` state. Any subsequent `Append` returns `ErrFatalIntegrity` immediately. The WTP `AppendEvent` calls `SinkChain.Fatal(err)` and returns. The composite store's `onAppendError` hook is invoked and the daemon decides whether to halt the agent (default) or continue with the WTP sink disabled (operator opt-in).

### Generation roll happens INSIDE Append

`Append` detects generation transitions and seals/rolls segments before writing the new record. This is the only place that can guarantee "single generation per segment" because the WAL writes records before the transport ever sees them.

```
Append(seq, gen, payload):
  if gen != currentSegment.generation:
    seal currentSegment:
      truncate to actual length
      fsync segment file
      rename .INPROGRESS → .seg
      fsync(segments/)
    open new segment with header.generation = gen
    fsync new segment header
    fsync(segments/)
    set AppendResult.GenerationRolled = true
  write framed record into currentSegment
  fsync per policy
  return AppendResult, nil
```

When `AppendResult.GenerationRolled == true`, the WTP `AppendEvent` notifies the transport to flush its current batch and emit a `SessionUpdate` with the new context digest before the new-generation batch begins. The chain itself rolls inside `audit.SinkChain.Compute` (it sees the new generation and uses `prev_hash = ""`).

### Lifecycle

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| Open | Scan `segments/`. Last `*.INPROGRESS` is the live segment; reopen for append. Replay all records, verifying CRCs and rebuilding `audit.SinkChain.prev_hash`. |
| Append | Detect generation change → seal/roll if needed. Write framed record. Fsync per policy (immediate, or deferred per `2026-04-13-deferred-sync`). |
| Segment full | Truncate to actual length, fsync, rename `.INPROGRESS` → `.seg`, open new `.INPROGRESS`. |
| Generation change | Detected inside Append (see above). |
| `SessionUpdate` write | Force fsync of live segment + meta.json. |
| `TransportLoss` write | Force fsync (operator visibility into loss must be durable). |
| Ack received | Update `meta.json` with new `ack_high_watermark`. GC fully-acked segments via `os.Remove` after fsync(parent). |
| Close | Fsync live segment, leave `.INPROGRESS` suffix in place (will be reopened on restart). |

### CRC corruption recovery

When a record fails CRC verification on read:

1. Log the corruption with segment file, offset, expected/actual CRC.
2. Compute coarse range: `from_seq = last_good_seq + 1`, `to_seq = last_good_seq + max(1, segment_remaining_bytes / typical_record_size)`. The estimate uses the segment's average record size from records read so far.
3. Emit `TransportLoss{from_seq, to_seq, generation: segment.generation, reason: "crc_corruption"}` into the WAL stream.
4. Increment `wtp_wal_corruption_total`.
5. Skip to the next segment (we do not attempt to scan-and-resync within a corrupted segment; the most common cause is a truncated tail, which extends to the segment end by definition).

This is best-effort. A v2 enhancement (per-record sequence in the frame header, +8 bytes/record overhead) would enable exact gap reporting and is deferred until operators report imprecise ranges in practice. Documented in §8.

### meta.json schema

```json
{
  "format_version": 2,
  "ack_high_watermark_seq": 12345,
  "ack_high_watermark_gen": 7,
  "ack_recorded": true,
  "session_id": "01J...ulid",
  "key_fingerprint": "sha256:abcd…"
}
```

Fields:

- `format_version` - schema version. Current writers MUST emit `2`. v1 readers (which only ever stored `(seq, gen)` because pre-v2 only `MarkAcked` wrote meta.json) are accepted on read; see "Migration / backcompat" below.
- `ack_high_watermark_seq` / `ack_high_watermark_gen` - the last `(generation, sequence)` tuple persisted via `MarkAcked`. Meaningless in isolation: the `ack_recorded` flag below is what makes this tuple "Present" for the §Effective-ack tuple and clamp's first-apply branch.
- `ack_recorded` - boolean mirror of `wal.Meta.AckRecorded`. **Required in v2.** False means "no ack has ever been recorded for this WAL directory; the ack-tuple fields above are zero-valued and meaningless." Maps directly to the AckTuple `Present` flag the cold-start seed passes into the transport (see §Effective-ack tuple and clamp): `Present == ack_recorded`. The first-apply branch of `applyServerAckTuple` is taken iff `ack_recorded == false` so the clamp does not trip on a legitimate zero seed.
- `session_id` / `key_fingerprint` - identity fields used by the cold-start seed safety check below. A stale meta.json from a previous installation cannot be silently consumed.

Atomically written via `os.WriteFile` on a temp + `os.Rename` + `fsync(parent)` using the existing `internal/audit/fsync_dir_unix.go` and `fsync_dir_windows.go` helpers.

**Migration / backcompat.** A v1 meta.json (no `ack_recorded` field) MUST be treated as `ack_recorded: true` on read regardless of the persisted ack-tuple values, because in pre-v2 only `MarkAcked` wrote meta.json - the file's existence implied an ack was persisted. (The implementation lives in `wal.ReadMeta`: see `internal/store/watchtower/wal/meta.go`.) After the next successful WAL flush, the meta.json is rewritten as v2 with the correct `ack_recorded` value (always true on the rewrite path because the rewrite happens through `MarkAcked`). v0 (no meta.json on disk) is the cold-cold-start case: callers receive `os.ErrNotExist` from `ReadMeta` and pass `Options.InitialAckTuple = nil`. The §Effective-ack tuple and clamp's first-apply branch then validates the first server tuple against local WAL data per the rules in that section (vacuous-zero adopt, otherwise gate on `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen)`); first-apply is NOT a wholesale adopt.

#### Cold-start seed safety / stale meta detection

Before constructing `Options.InitialAckTuple`, the caller (Store-wiring layer) MUST compare `wal.Meta.SessionID` and `wal.Meta.KeyFingerprint` against the values configured for the current process. The fields exist explicitly to defend against silently consuming meta from a different installation or a rotated key - the persisted state could otherwise be cryptographically un-attributable to the current key, or could carry an ack history that belongs to a different session entirely.

Identity is ESTABLISHED on first writer (first-writer-wins immutability): a fresh WAL directory adopts whatever `(SessionID, KeyFingerprint)` the first writer presents and persists it via the next meta.json rewrite. Once persisted, identity is **immutable** for the lifetime of the WAL directory; later writers presenting different values are rejected via the **quarantine policy** below. `wal.OpenWAL` is responsible for the comparison; its caller passes the configured identity through `Options.SessionID` and `Options.KeyFingerprint`, and `OpenWAL` returns a typed `wal.ErrIdentityMismatch{Field, Persisted, Expected}` error on mismatch (so the wiring layer can branch on the typed error rather than string-match).

**Quarantine policy (mismatch handling).** When `OpenWAL` returns `ErrIdentityMismatch` (either `session_id` or `key_fingerprint` differs from the persisted meta.json values), the wiring layer's recovery action is to **rename the entire WAL directory** to `<dir>.quarantine.<unix-nanos>-<random4hex>` (where `<unix-nanos>` is the nanoseconds-since-epoch at the moment of the rename and `<random4hex>` is 4 hex characters from `crypto/rand` - i.e. 16 random bits) and **open a fresh WAL** at the original path. The nanos+random4hex naming defends against rapid-restart collision: a Unix-seconds suffix would collide on rapid restart loops (sub-second apart, common during crash-loop or container restart storms), and even nanosecond resolution is not collision-free across a virtualised clock or a NAS that rounds mtimes. Adding 16 random bits drops the collision probability to negligible even when the daemon restarts in a tight loop AND the kernel clock has a coarse virtual resolution.

**Probe-then-rename collision handling (Round 12 Finding 6).** The wiring layer MUST use a probe-then-rename pattern instead of a blind `os.Rename`: the candidate path is first probed via `os.Lstat`, and `os.Rename` is only attempted when the probe returns `errors.Is(err, fs.ErrNotExist)`. This pattern survives a benign race where two processes (or a restart loop with a coarse-resolution clock) compute the same nanos+random suffix in the same instant: the loser's `Lstat` returns a non-NotExist result (or a successful stat), the loser regenerates a fresh suffix, and the loop retries. Naïve `os.Rename` MAY clobber existing directories on some filesystems (for example POSIX-conformant `rename(2)` overwrites an empty target, and a directory rename onto an empty dir succeeds atomically) - the probe gate prevents the clobber. The retry loop is bounded at **8 attempts**: in the worst-case rapid-restart scenario, 16 random bits gives a collision probability per attempt of `2^-16` (~1.5×10⁻⁵), so 8 retries drops aggregate collision probability to `(2^-16)^8 ≈ 10⁻³⁹` - well below any practically observable rate. After 8 failed attempts the wiring layer surfaces a hard error rather than entering an infinite loop. Each retry generates a fresh `<random4hex>` from `crypto/rand` (the `<unix-nanos>` component MAY be re-sampled on each iteration so a slow loop benefits from clock advancement, but the predominant collision-resolution force is the random component).

Increment `wtp_wal_quarantine_total{reason="session_id_mismatch"|"key_fingerprint_mismatch"}` (a counter - see Task 22b). Log a one-time WARN naming the field that mismatched, the persisted vs. expected values, the path the directory was renamed to, and the action taken ("quarantined; opened fresh WAL").

**Fate of buffered-but-unsent data in the quarantined WAL.** Records that were buffered in the old WAL but had not yet been acknowledged are **NOT recovered** - the quarantine path does not attempt to drain or replay them through the fresh WAL. The quarantined directory is preserved on disk for **operator inspection only** (it can be opened manually with the `wal` package's read-only Reader API or examined with the existing audit tooling); there is no automatic replay path back into the live stream. The data is not deleted on its own - operators decide when to remove the quarantine directory after extracting whatever forensics they need.

**Operator story.** The quarantine policy is deliberately conservative: it preserves all on-disk state for forensics, never silently consumes a meta from a foreign installation, and never auto-merges. There is **no automatic cleanup** of `<dir>.quarantine.*` directories - operators must clear them manually (or via an out-of-band cron) once the contents have been inspected. There is **no built-in recovery** of buffered-but-unsent records from a quarantined WAL into the live stream - if those records matter, operators extract them via the audit tooling and re-inject them through the appropriate replay path (which is out of scope for the WTP client phase). The `wtp_wal_quarantine_total` counter is the operator-visible signal that a quarantine has happened and the WAL has been re-cold-started; any non-zero rate warrants investigation of the source of the identity drift (key rotation procedure, session-rotation handoff, accidental WAL directory reuse across deployments).

A `wal.Meta` v1 file (no identity fields) is treated by `OpenWAL` as a successful identity match - the v1-to-v2 migration is the only path that adopts the configured identity into the persisted meta on its first rewrite. After the next ack-driven `MarkAcked` rewrites meta.json as v2, the configured identity becomes the immutable persisted identity from that point on.

### Reader API

```go
type Reader struct { /* private */ }

func (w *WAL) NewReader(start uint64) (*Reader, error)
func (r *Reader) Notify() <-chan struct{}    // signaled when new records appended
func (r *Reader) Next() (Record, error)      // io.EOF when caught up
func (r *Reader) Close() error

func (w *WAL) MarkAcked(seq uint64) error    // GC fully-acked segments
```

The transport goroutine consumes via the reader; it does not poll. Notifications coalesce naturally - one wakeup may correspond to many appended records. The reader surfaces `TransportLoss` and generation-roll markers as ordinary records (with a typed kind field) so the transport state machine handles them in the same select branch as data records.

## Transport Package (`internal/store/watchtower/transport`)

### Conn interface and Dialer pattern

```go
type Conn interface {
    Send(ctx context.Context, msg *wtpv1.ClientMessage) error
    Recv(ctx context.Context) (*wtpv1.ServerMessage, error)
    CloseSend() error
    Close() error
}

type Dialer interface {
    Dial(ctx context.Context) (Conn, error)
}
```

Production: `GRPCDialer` wraps `grpc.NewClient` with TLS 1.3 credentials, ALPN `wtp/1`, configured timeouts, and the bidi stream `Watchtower/Stream`. Tests: `srv.DialerFor()` on an in-process `testserver.Server` returns a `transport.Dialer` backed by `bufconn` and a scenario-driven server (see `internal/store/watchtower/testserver/`).

The transport package never references `grpc-go` types in its own API surface, so tests don't need a real network listener.

### State machine (single goroutine)

```go
type state int

const (
    stateConnecting state = iota
    stateReplaying
    stateLive
    stateShutdown
)
```

The goroutine runs `for { select { … } }`. The set of events depends on state:

| State | select branches |
|---|---|
| `stateConnecting` | `dialResult`, `ctx.Done()` |
| `stateReplaying`  | `replayDone`, `replayBatchSent`, `recv`, `ctx.Done()` |
| `stateLive`       | `walReader.Notify()`, `flushTimer.C`, `heartbeatTimer.C`, `recv`, `ctx.Done()` |
| `stateShutdown`   | `drainDone`, `gracefulCloseTimeout`, `ctx.Done()` |

`recv` is fed by a small companion goroutine that calls `Conn.Recv` in a loop; this is the only other goroutine in the package. It exits when the stream closes.

### Batcher invariants (per spec §7)

A `Batcher` accumulates `CompactEvent`s and flushes when **any** of the following triggers:

- Generation change: next event's generation differs from current batch.
- Time span: oldest event in batch is older than `max_event_timespan` (default 5s).
- Event count: `>= max_events_per_batch` (default 256).
- Byte budget (post-compression): estimated `>= max_batch_bytes` (default 256 KiB).
- Flush timer: `flush_interval` elapsed (default 1s; 200ms in ephemeral mode).
- Generation rollover (sequence wrap): forces a fresh batch.

Each invariant is enforced by a single function (`Batcher.Add` returns `(addedToBatch, shouldFlush)`); making the Batcher entirely table-test-driven.

### Replayer

On `stateReplaying`:

```go
for seq := ackHighWatermark + 1; seq <= walHighWatermark; seq++ {
    rec := walReader.Next()
    batcher.Add(rec)
    if batcher.ShouldFlush() {
        send(batcher.Drain())
        if err { goto reconnect }
    }
}
sendFinalBatchIfAny()
state = stateLive
```

Replay batches obey the same invariants as live batches; the only difference is the source of records. The server may legitimately return a stale (lower) ack watermark during gradual rollout or partition recovery; the replayer treats the ack watermark as a `(generation, sequence)` TUPLE and applies the lex-`(gen, seq)` clamp described under §"Acknowledgement model" below. The clamp is type-enforced - the two fields move together or neither does - because the WAL's segment GC sorts by lex `(gen, seq)` and mixing local-seq with server-gen would create an impossible state.

### Heartbeat

A `heartbeatTimer` ticks at `heartbeat_interval` (default 30s; 10s in ephemeral mode). On tick: send `Heartbeat`. If two consecutive heartbeats elapse with no inbound message (ack or ServerHeartbeat), set `state = stateConnecting` (reconnect with backoff).

### Acknowledgement model

WTP uses three distinct server→client acknowledgement messages with disjoint semantics. Conflating them is a common source of bugs in early implementations.

| Message | When sent | What it advances |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionAck` | Once, immediately after the server validates `SessionInit`. | Both the session lifecycle (the client moves out of Connecting) AND both ack cursors. `accepted=false` terminates the session - the client MUST disconnect and surface `reject_reason`. On `accepted=true`, the carried `(generation, ack_high_watermark_seq)` is fed through the SAME clamp as `BatchAck` and `ServerHeartbeat` (see §"Effective-ack tuple and clamp" below). Session lifecycle and cursor advancement happen in the same handler. |
| `BatchAck` | Per batch the server has durably accepted (or batched into a single ack covering several client batches). Carries `ack_high_watermark_seq` and `generation`. | Both ack cursors per the §"Effective-ack tuple and clamp" rules: server-higher advances `persistedAck` (driving WAL segment GC and `wtp_ack_high_watermark`) AND `remoteReplayCursor`; server-lower advances ONLY `remoteReplayCursor` (no `wal.MarkAcked` call), so the next replay window re-sends the gap. |
| `ServerHeartbeat` | Periodic, even when the client is idle. Carries the server's current `ack_high_watermark_seq`. | Same clamp as `BatchAck`. Used to confirm liveness AND catch up the client after long idle periods (the heartbeat may carry an ack-watermark advance the client has not seen via BatchAck - e.g. when a previous BatchAck was lost on a stream reset). |

`SessionUpdate` is NOT an acknowledgement - it is a control frame for key or generation rotation, sent by either side. The `ack_timeout` reconnect reason fires when no `BatchAck` (NOT `SessionUpdate`, NOT `ServerHeartbeat`) arrives within the configured window for in-flight batches.

**Wire-ordering and lifecycle of ack-bearing frames.** The recv path MUST preserve total wire order between `BatchAck` and `ServerHeartbeat` events. Both kinds are demuxed onto a single bounded FIFO channel inside the recv multiplexer; the main goroutine selects one event at a time and runs the clamp dispatch (`applyAckFromRecv`) to completion before pulling the next. Heartbeats are NOT coalesced - coalescing was the round-6 design and was rejected in round-22 because it lets an older heartbeat be processed AFTER a newer higher-generation `BatchAck`, which then reinterprets the heartbeat as belonging to the new generation (`ServerHeartbeat` carries no generation field on the wire; the client substitutes `t.persistedAck.Generation` at apply time, so re-ordering corrupts the substitution). Strict FIFO order makes the heartbeat substitution rule safe by construction: any earlier `BatchAck` with a different generation has already been processed (and therefore has already advanced `t.persistedAck.Generation` if it was an Adopted outcome) before the heartbeat reaches the dispatch site. Channel back-pressure under a wedged main goroutine is bounded by the heartbeat-deadline timer, which fires on the per-connection ctx and forces a reconnect. (**Task 18 dependency:** the heartbeat-deadline timer is not yet implemented; until then, back-pressure on `eventCh` is bounded only by ctx cancellation from `teardownRecv` - i.e. by whatever wakes the per-connection ctx, which today is exclusively the state-handler exit paths in `state_live.go` / `state_replaying.go`. Operators should treat a wedged main goroutine as undetected by Phase 4 and rely on connectivity checks at higher layers until Task 18 lands.)

**Per-connection recv lifecycle.** The recv multiplexer's state - the ack-event channel, the recv-error channel, and the per-connection cancellation ctx - is held in a `recvSession` struct that is created fresh on each successful dial and discarded on every tear-down. No state crosses a reconnect boundary: a stale heartbeat queued on the old session, a recv-error from the old stream, and the recv goroutine itself all die when the per-connection ctx is cancelled (which happens on every state-exit path that closes the conn, including transport-wide `ctx.Done()` shutdowns AND state-local errors that only kill THIS connection). The connection-scoped ctx is the only thing that can wake a recv goroutine blocked on a full event channel; the transport-wide ctx alone is insufficient because state-local errors must be able to drop a connection without shutting down the transport. The per-connection `recvSession` lifecycle described here is exercised by tests today via the `StartRecvForTest`/`TeardownRecvForTest` seams; production wiring lands in **Task 22** (Store integration) when `runConnecting` starts the recv goroutine after SessionAck acceptance.

**Operator observability for fail-closed recv branches.** The recv goroutine's fail-closed control-frame branches (`Goaway`, `ServerUpdate`, unknown frame types) MUST emit operator-distinguishable signals so that a reconnect storm caused by, e.g., the server issuing repeated `Goaway` frames is debuggable without log correlation. The current state at commit `7daa69eb` and the future structured-log contract are explicitly distinguished below.

**Current state (commit `7daa69eb`).** The recv multiplexer in `internal/store/watchtower/transport/recv_multiplexer.go` (the three branches near lines 222-250) pushes plain Go errors onto `rs.errCh` for `Goaway`, `ServerUpdate`, and unknown frame types. The error string is the only operator-visible signal today - there is NO `slog.Warn(...)` call on these branches yet, NO structured `reason` field, and NO WARN-level log entry the operator can grep for. The transport's reconnect counter (`wtp_reconnects_total`) is defined in `internal/metrics/wtp.go:27-58` with the original seven labels (`dial_failed | stream_recv_error | send_error | ack_timeout | heartbeat_timeout | server_goaway | unknown`) - but **no non-test `IncReconnects(...)` call site exists in the transport package today** (verified by grep across `internal/store/watchtower/transport/`). The two future labels (`server_update_unsupported`, `recv_unknown_frame`) do NOT exist in the schema yet either; they land in Task 22c Steps 1-3 (schema-only). Tasks 18 and 19 add their fail-closed reconnect emitters ONLY AFTER Task 22c Steps 1-3 land - the schema for `server_update_unsupported` and `recv_unknown_frame` MUST already be registered (even if at zero) so the emitters target the dedicated labels from day one. There is no interim "emitter wired against legacy labels, awaiting schema expansion + relabel" rollout state because the schema lands first and the emitters land second:

- **`Goaway`** - Future Tasks 18/19 will wire `metrics.IncReconnects(metrics.WTPReconnectReasonServerGoaway)` so this branch drives `wtp_reconnects_total{reason="server_goaway"}` (existing label, kept across the Task 22c transition). Until then, only the bare error string distinguishes it. The recv goroutine today surfaces an ordinary recv-error envelope on `errCh` carrying the `goaway` substring (literal: `recv: control frame goaway not yet handled`); the main goroutine's `recvErrCh` arm regresses to Connecting on the next select iteration without incrementing any metric.
- **`ServerUpdate`** - Future Tasks 18/19 will wire `metrics.IncReconnects(metrics.WTPReconnectReasonServerUpdateUnsupported)` so this branch drives `wtp_reconnects_total{reason="server_update_unsupported"}` from day one (the dedicated label is a hard prereq from Task 22c Steps 1-3 - there is no interim collapse onto `unknown`). Until the emitter lands, only the bare error string distinguishes the branch. `errCh` envelope today carries the `session_update` substring (literal: `recv: control frame session_update not yet handled`).
- **Unknown frame types** - Future Tasks 18/19 will wire `metrics.IncReconnects(metrics.WTPReconnectReasonRecvUnknownFrame)` so this branch drives `wtp_reconnects_total{reason="recv_unknown_frame"}` from day one (same hard-prereq rationale as `ServerUpdate`). Until the emitter lands, only the bare error string distinguishes the branch. `errCh` envelope today carries the unknown `%T` discriminator (literal: `recv: unknown control frame %T, returning to Connecting`). This is the proto-evolution defence: a future server may add control frames the client predates, and silently dropping them risks correctness.

Until Tasks 18/19 (emitter wiring), Task 22c (metric-label expansion), AND Task 22d (structured WARN logging) all land, operators distinguish branches via the `errCh` substring or by inspecting the proto frame type at the transport diagnostic layer. This `errCh`-substring guidance is **transitional debugging only**, suitable for one-off incident triage; it MUST NOT become the canonical operator contract because string substrings are brittle to refactors.

**Future contract (owned by Tasks 18/19 + 22c + 22d).** The end-state operator surface is two-pronged:

- A structured WARN log entry will be emitted at the recv error point with a stable `reason=<string>` field, distinguishing the three branches before the connection tears down. The reason strings will be: `goaway_received` (Goaway), `server_update_unsupported_in_phase_4` (ServerUpdate), `recv_unknown_frame_type` (unknown frame). These strings are STRUCTURED LOG FIELDS, not metric label values. Owned by **Task 22d** (see plan §"Task 22d: Structured WARN logging for fail-closed recv branches").
- The `wtp_reconnects_total{reason}` schema gains dedicated labels `server_update_unsupported` and `recv_unknown_frame` so the fail-closed branches each have their own metric label from the moment a producer exists. Owned by **Task 22c** (see plan §"Task 22c: WTP reconnect-reason schema expansion for fail-closed control frames"); Task 22c Steps 1-3 are a hard prerequisite of the Tasks 18/19 emitter wiring (see Task 18 / Task 19 §"Prerequisite (rollout-order gate)"), so by the time any non-test emitter exists, the dedicated label is already registered and the producer never feeds the legacy `unknown` label. The `Goaway` branch keeps its existing `server_goaway` label across this transition (no schema change needed for that label).
- The actual `IncReconnects(...)` call sites for all three branches (Goaway, ServerUpdate, unknown frame) land in **Tasks 18 and 19** as part of the broader reconnect-plumbing work in those tasks.

Once all four tasks land, the canonical operator surface is the dedicated metric labels for the rate signal AND the structured WARN log's `reason` field for the per-branch discriminator; the transitional `errCh` substring guidance is then removed. All three categories will be distinguishable from ordinary recv I/O failures (which drive `wtp_reconnects_total{reason="stream_recv_error"}`) and from each other via both surfaces.

**`goaway_message` redaction policy (conservative-default; internal/construction-time-only opt-in).** The `Goaway` WARN log MAY include server-supplied free-text in the `goaway_message` field, but the **default policy is conservative**: the message text is **OMITTED** from the WARN payload, and a short marker (`goaway_message_present=true|false`) records only whether the server sent any message. The verbatim-after-sanitization mode exists as an **internal/construction-time flag only** on `transport.Options` (used by tests and direct constructor callers); it is **NOT exposed via daemon configuration** today and is gated on the Watchtower-server-side contract that forbids secrets in `Goaway.message`.

**Server-side contract dependency (follow-up tracker).** The "no secrets, credentials, or PII in `Goaway.message`" guarantee is a Watchtower-server-side contract that MUST be published in the server's protocol documentation BEFORE the client's verbatim opt-in is recommended for production use. The proto package is `proto/canyonroad/wtp/v1/wtp.proto`, so the server lives in the canyonroad repo. **Owning team:** Watchtower server / canyonroad team (per-team alias TBD - replace with the concrete alias from the canyonroad repo's `OWNERS`/`CODEOWNERS` when known; until then, the team alias placeholder is `@canyonroad/wtp-server-team`). **Concrete completion artifact (the unblock signal for client-side Task 27b):** a merged canyonroad PR/spec that adds the no-secrets contract language to either the `Goaway` proto comment in `proto/canyonroad/wtp/v1/wtp.proto` OR a server-protocol design doc, AND a written acknowledgement (issue comment, doc link, or RFC sign-off) from the server team's technical lead. **Tracking link:** `<canyonroad PR/issue link TBD - populate when the PR opens; until populated, this dependency is the explicit blocker for Task 27b kickoff>`. Until that contract is published and the link above is populated (link from this spec when it lands), the client defaults to the conservative policy described below. The client-side follow-up that consumes the published server contract - adding `LogGoawayMessage` to `AuditWatchtowerConfig`, wiring it through to `transport.Options`, writing operator-facing documentation, and deciding whether to flip the default - is owned by **Task 27b: WTP `LogGoawayMessage` config surface expansion** (see plan; Task 27b's "Hard prerequisites" enumerates this dependency as one of three explicit gates). Operators who need the verbatim message in production while the contract is still pending MUST take responsibility for their own server-side redaction posture (e.g. by trusting only their own internal Watchtower deployments) AND today have NO daemon-config-level lever to enable it - the only path is direct construction of `transport.Options` (test/embedded callers).

**Default policy (until server contract published AND Task 27b lands).** The WARN log includes ONLY the standard fields plus `goaway_code` (string mirror of the proto enum) and `goaway_retry_immediately` (bool). The `goaway_message` field is OMITTED from the WARN payload; a single info marker `goaway_message_present=<bool>` is emitted so operators can tell whether the server sent any message text at all (useful for triage: "code=DRAINING with empty message" vs "code=DRAINING with explanatory text" are operationally distinct even when the text itself is suppressed). This is the policy ALL daemon-driven production deployments see today - there is no operator-facing toggle. **Three-state semantics for the future daemon-config field (forward-binding):** when Task 27b lands the `audit.watchtower.log_goaway_message` daemon config field, that field MUST use a presence-bearing `*bool` (NOT a plain `bool`) so the unset case is distinguishable from explicit `false`. The three states are: (1) **`unset`** (field omitted) - daemon resolves to the PRD-defined-default-at-this-major-version, currently `false`; daemon emits a single INFO at startup so an operator reading logs after a future default-flip can confirm whether their fleet picked up the change implicitly; (2) **`*bool == false`** (explicit `false`) - same runtime behavior as `unset`, no startup log; (3) **`*bool == true`** (explicit `true`) - opt in to verbatim sanitized `goaway_message` logging; daemon emits a single WARN at startup reminding the operator the server-side no-secrets contract is the trust boundary. **Default-flip migration policy (binding even before Task 27b lands):** any change to the PRD-defined-default-at-this-major-version is a major-version bump in the daemon config schema and MUST follow the explicit migration steps in plan §"Task 27b" Step 4 (schema major-version bump, release notes, spec update, retain the unset-INFO log). Silent default flips are forbidden because they would expose `goaway_message` to log aggregators on upgrade for any fleet that omitted the field.

**Reload model (forward-binding).** The `transport.Options.LogGoawayMessage` flag is read at transport-construction time and is NOT hot-reloadable. Today this is moot because there is no daemon-config surface at all; once Task 27b adds one, changes to `audit.watchtower.log_goaway_message` will take effect ONLY after the transport is reconstructed, which means a daemon restart (the watchtower store / audit sink is built once at daemon startup; there is no in-place reload path for `audit.watchtower.*`). Operator docs delivered as part of Task 27b MUST state this explicitly so operators know (a) editing the field while the daemon is running has no immediate effect, and (b) the verification procedure for "did my flag flip take effect?" is a daemon restart followed by inspection of the startup log line described in the three-state semantics above. If a future task adds a reload mechanism for `audit.watchtower.*`, that task is responsible for re-deriving the new transport.Options and reconstructing the transport - Task 27b explicitly defers that work.

**Internal/construction-time opt-in (`transport.Options.LogGoawayMessage`).** The transport's `Options` struct exposes `LogGoawayMessage bool` (default `false`) as an internal/construction-time flag for tests and direct constructor callers. Setting it to `true` enables the verbatim-after-sanitization logging described in the Task 22d WARN field schema. The field's doc comment MUST state explicitly that it is internal/construction-time only and is NOT plumbed from `AuditWatchtowerConfig` today - the config-surface expansion is owned by Task 27b. When the opt-in is enabled, server-supplied messages are logged after sanitization (sanitize THEN truncate - see Task 22d for the exact contract; ALL C0 controls including `\n` and `\t`, DEL, and invalid-UTF-8 sequences replaced with U+FFFD; sanitized output truncated to 512 bytes at a UTF-8 rune boundary with a `...[truncated]` marker) but otherwise verbatim.

**Custom slog handlers.** The transport accepts any `*slog.Logger`. The sanitizer's handler-agnostic policy (replacing all C0 controls including `\n` and `\t` with U+FFFD) means the WARN payload is safe regardless of handler choice - no log-injection risk from server-supplied control characters, whether the operator's logger uses `slog.JSONHandler`, `slog.TextHandler`, or a custom handler.

**Sanitizer scope (always present).** The client-side sanitization helper (`sanitizeForLog`) is implemented and tested unconditionally - the test surface for the sanitizer is independent of whether the production default invokes it. This ensures a future flip of the opt-in default (Task 27b) does not require a parallel test backfill. The sanitizer is the safety net for transport-layer log poisoning (oversized payloads, control bytes, mojibake) but NOT for credential redaction - the contract owner for "no secrets in `Goaway.message`" is the server, not the client.

**Cross-references.** Task 22d's Step 2 schema describes the conservative-default WARN payload AND the opt-in payload, with both forms reachable through the same internal/construction-time `LogGoawayMessage` flag on `transport.Options`. Task 27b owns the daemon-config-surface expansion that depends on the published server contract. AGENTS.md / repo-wide privacy policy should be consulted before broadening this stance; the current project has no stricter cross-cutting redaction policy that would require additional client-side filtering here.

**Lifecycle states for reconnect-reason observability.** This subsection's operator contract evolves through four named states; the spec wording you are reading currently describes state 0 (the actual code reality at commit `7daa69eb`). There is no interim migration state because Task 22c Steps 1-3 (the schema-only delta) land BEFORE any non-test fail-closed emitter exists in Tasks 18/19 - by the time an emitter for `server_update_unsupported` or `recv_unknown_frame` exists in non-test code, the schema label is already registered (zero-emit), so the emitter targets the dedicated label from day one and there is no "wired against legacy collapsed label, awaiting relabel" intermediate.

0. **Pre-schema, pre-emitter (current state, commit `7daa69eb`)** - The recv multiplexer pushes a plain Go `error` onto `rs.errCh` for `Goaway`, `ServerUpdate`, and unknown frame types; the error string is the only operator-visible signal. The transport-level reconnect counter (`wtp_reconnects_total`) is defined in `internal/metrics/wtp.go:27-58` with the original seven labels (`dial_failed | stream_recv_error | send_error | ack_timeout | heartbeat_timeout | server_goaway | unknown`) but **no non-test `IncReconnects(...)` call site exists in the transport package today** - those land in Tasks 18 (heartbeat) and 19 (shutdown/drain, plus the three fail-closed recv branches). The two future labels (`server_update_unsupported`, `recv_unknown_frame`) do NOT exist in the schema yet; they land in Task 22c. The three branches' "future label" mappings described above are advisory for planning purposes only - there is no producer for ANY reconnect-reason label today.
1. **Schema landed, emitter not wired** - Task 22c Steps 1-3 (metric-schema-only) lands the two new labels (`server_update_unsupported`, `recv_unknown_frame`) in `wtpReconnectReasonsValid` and `wtpReconnectReasonsEmitOrder`, so they appear in `/metrics` at zero on registration via the always-emit contract. No code path increments any of the seven-or-nine reconnect labels yet (that wiring is Tasks 18/19), AND no structured WARN log carries the `reason` field (that emission is Task 22d). The interim spec wording (state 0 above) STAYS IN EFFECT throughout this state; operators still read the existing labels and the bare `errCh` error string for diagnostics - the new labels are visible but flat-zero.
2. **Emitter wired** - the `IncReconnects(...)` call sites for ALL THREE fail-closed branches (Goaway → `server_goaway`, ServerUpdate → `server_update_unsupported`, unknown frame → `recv_unknown_frame`) land in transport (in Tasks 18 / 19, paired with the actual reconnect plumbing) AND `slog.Warn(... reason=...)` calls land in the three recv-multiplexer branches (Task 22d). Operators can now filter by the dedicated metric labels and grep the structured WARN log's `reason` field. The interim spec wording is now stale-but-correct (it under-describes what the system actually emits); the spec rewrite to end-state is gated on this state being reached, see state 3.
3. **End-state spec wording active** - Task 22c Step 4 promotes this subsection to describe the dedicated labels as the live operator surface and removes the transitional `errCh`-substring guidance. Step 4 MUST NOT run until Tasks 18 and 19 have landed the emitter call sites for ALL THREE fail-closed branches (Goaway included) AND Task 22d has landed the WARN logging; otherwise the spec would describe operator-visible labels as "live" when they are actually zero-valued series with no producer, and the WARN field as queryable when no log line carries it.

#### Effective-ack tuple and clamp

The effective ack watermark is split into TWO distinct cursors held on the client. They diverge ONLY during stale-server recovery; the rest of the time they hold the same tuple value.

1. **`persistedAck` (gen, seq)** - the *durable* ack watermark. Mirror of the WAL's `meta.json` `(AckHighWatermarkGen, AckHighWatermarkSeq, AckRecorded)` triple, advanced via `wal.MarkAcked`. **Monotonic only**: under lex `(gen, seq)` it never moves backward, because (a) the WAL implementation enforces this directly in `wal.MarkAcked` (`internal/store/watchtower/wal/wal.go` - the `advance` predicate is one-way) and (b) WAL segment GC keys off this tuple - once a segment is GC'd at watermark `W`, the records it held cannot be re-materialised, so any "rolled-back" persistedAck would be a lie. Seeded on cold start from `wal.ReadMeta` (gated by the §"Cold-start seed safety / stale meta detection" identity checks). The Transport mirror lives in `t.persistedAck (gen, seq)` plus a `t.persistedAckPresent` flag (mirrors `wal.Meta.AckRecorded`).

2. **`remoteReplayCursor` (gen, seq)** - the *server-belief* cursor. Where the server thinks its ack watermark sits. May be lex-LOWER than `persistedAck` if the server (gradual rollout or partition recovery) presents a stale tuple **with the same generation as `persistedAck`**. Drives the **Replaying state's reader-start calculation**: the replay reader opens at `remoteReplayCursor + 1` (NOT `persistedAck + 1`) so the gap between the cursors is re-sent. Lives in `t.remoteReplayCursor (gen, seq)` on Transport. The `gen` field is retained for logging/metrics symmetry; the WAL Reader API today is sequence-keyed (`(*WAL).NewReader(start uint64)` in `internal/store/watchtower/wal/reader.go:116`) and operates within whatever generation the segments on disk encode, so the cursor's `gen` is informational on the replay-start path.

In the steady state `remoteReplayCursor == persistedAck`. They diverge briefly during stale-server recovery and reconverge on the next `BatchAck` for the re-sent records. **Lower-generation regressions are out of scope for this phase.** The Reader API does not accept a `(gen, seq)` start tuple - it accepts only `start uint64` and filters by sequence within the segments it walks, and segment sequences reset on every generation roll (so a generation-blind seq compare across generations would silently drop or re-send records). The `LossRecord` carries a single `Generation`, so a cross-generation gap cannot be represented cleanly in one marker either. Generation-aware lower-generation replay would require a generation-aware Reader API and multi-generation loss markers - neither exists today, and adding both is out-of-scope for the WTP client phase. The clamp helper therefore restricts the legitimate `ResendNeeded` outcome to the same-generation case, AND restricts the legitimate higher-generation `Adopted` outcome to the sub-case where the local WAL has actually emitted RecordData in the server's generation (`wal.WrittenDataHighWater(server_gen)` returns `(maxDataSeq, true)` AND `server_seq <= maxDataSeq`). Lower-generation server tuples always take the anomaly path; higher-generation server tuples take the anomaly path when the WAL has not emitted any RecordData in that generation (`wal.WrittenDataHighWater(server_gen)` returns `(_, false)`) OR when it has emitted data but the server's seq is past the per-gen data-bearing high-water (`wal.WrittenDataHighWater(server_gen)` returns `(maxDataSeq, true)` AND `server_seq > maxDataSeq`). The per-generation data-bearing accessor is mandatory because the WAL's internal `w.highGen` is seeded from segment headers during recovery (wal.go:340) BEFORE any RecordData lands, so a header-only generation cannot be used as evidence the writer ever emitted data - admitting an ack for a header-only generation would let `wal.MarkAcked` accept a fabricated tuple and lex GC discard surviving lower-gen segments.

Every server-supplied watermark - `SessionAck`, `BatchAck`, and `ServerHeartbeat` - is applied through the same clamp helper (`applyServerAckTuple`). The helper is a **pure classifier**: it mutates `t.persistedAck`, `t.remoteReplayCursor`, and `t.persistedAckPresent` in memory according to the case below and returns a typed `AckOutcome` (`AckOutcomeAdopted`, `AckOutcomeAnomaly`, `AckOutcomeResendNeeded`, `AckOutcomeNoOp`). The helper itself does **NOT** call `wal.MarkAcked` and does **NOT** emit log lines or metric increments. Persistence and operator-visible side effects live in the per-frame dispatchers (`ackSessionAck` in `transport/state_connecting.go`, `ackBatchAck` / `ackServerHeartbeat` in the Live-state files), which inspect the returned `AckOutcome.Kind` and:

- on `AckOutcomeAdopted`, snapshot `(persistedAck, remoteReplayCursor, persistedAckPresent)` BEFORE the helper call, then call `wal.MarkAcked(t.persistedAck.Generation, t.persistedAck.Sequence)` AFTER. On non-nil error from `wal.MarkAcked`, the dispatcher rolls all three fields back to the snapshot (so the in-memory mirror stays in lock-step with on-disk meta.json) and emits a WARN; on success, it emits `SetAckHighWatermark`.
- on `AckOutcomeAnomaly`, fire a rate-limited WARN (per the Operational signals subsection) and increment `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason}`. Cursors stay UNCHANGED - the helper already left them untouched.
- on `AckOutcomeResendNeeded`, log INFO with both tuples and increment `wtp_resend_needed_total`. `persistedAck` stays UNCHANGED; `remoteReplayCursor` was lex-lowered by the helper so the next replay window opens at the regressed position.
- on `AckOutcomeNoOp`, no side effects.

Keeping `wal.MarkAcked` out of the helper means the helper has no I/O dependency, no rollback complexity, and is unit-testable as a pure function over `(serverGen, serverSeq, t.persistedAck, t.remoteReplayCursor, t.persistedAckPresent, walAccessors)`. The helper's outcomes (described in terms of the cursor mutation it performs):

- **First apply (no prior `persistedAck` recorded, i.e., `t.persistedAckPresent == false`)**: the helper validates the server tuple against local WAL data BEFORE adopting; the wholesale-adoption design considered in earlier rounds was abandoned in round-15 because seeding `persistedAck` at an impossible position (e.g. server reports `(gen=8, seq=200)` against a WAL that only ever wrote `(gen=8, seq=1..50)` because the agent's WAL was wiped or restored from a snapshot) drives the per-generation lex GC predicate past surviving records and silently deletes records that have not yet been delivered. The first-apply branch therefore short-circuits the same WAL validation rules used by the higher-gen and higher-same-gen-advance branches:
  - **`server_seq == 0` AND `wal.HasDataBelowGeneration(serverGen)` returns `(false, nil)`**: vacuous "I haven't acked anything yet" within `serverGen` AND no data-bearing record exists in any lower generation locally - adopt unconditionally into BOTH cursors and return `AckOutcomeAdopted` (the dispatcher then calls `wal.MarkAcked(serverGen, 0)` per the helper-vs-dispatcher split above). No anomaly log. The `HasDataBelowGeneration` gate is the round-16 Finding 1 fix: without it, adopting `(serverGen, 0)` when local data exists at any generation `g < serverGen` would lex-over-ack every lower-gen record via `wal.MarkAcked` (whose `segmentFullyAckedLocked` predicate reclaims any segment with `segGen < ackHighGen`) and silently destroy not-yet-delivered records on the next GC pass. Same-generation `(G, 0)` against a WAL with only same-gen-or-newer data is still safe - `HasDataBelowGeneration(G)` is `false` because the map only tracks generations that have data and any same-gen entry compares equal, not strictly less than.
  - **`server_seq == 0` AND `wal.HasDataBelowGeneration(serverGen)` returns `(true, nil)`**: take the Anomaly path with `AnomalyReason="server_ack_exceeds_local_data"`. Cursors and `persistedAckPresent` stay UNCHANGED. The server is implicitly claiming "every prior generation is fully acked" by adopting `(serverGen, 0)` against a state where lower-gen data still exists locally - same safety class as the explicit `serverSeq > maxDataSeq` case. Increment `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason="server_ack_exceeds_local_data"}`.
  - **`wal.HasDataBelowGeneration(serverGen)` returns `(_, err != nil)` (round-16 Finding 1 sibling)**: take the Anomaly path with `AnomalyReason="wal_read_failure"`. Cursors and `persistedAckPresent` stay UNCHANGED so a subsequent ack re-runs the seed gate against a (presumably) recovered WAL. Increment `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason="wal_read_failure"}`.
  - **`wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen)` returns `(_, _, err != nil)`**: take the Anomaly path with `AnomalyReason="wal_read_failure"`. Cursors and `persistedAckPresent` stay UNCHANGED so a subsequent ack re-runs the seed gate against a (presumably) recovered WAL. Increment `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason="wal_read_failure"}`.
  - **`wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen)` returns `(_, false, nil)`**: take the Anomaly path with `AnomalyReason="unwritten_generation"`. The WAL has never written RecordData in `serverGen` locally, so the server cannot legitimately ack any seq in it.
  - **`wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen)` returns `(maxDataSeq, true, nil)` AND `serverSeq > maxDataSeq`**: take the Anomaly path with `AnomalyReason="server_ack_exceeds_local_data"`. The server is past our highest local data-bearing seq.
  - **Otherwise (`serverSeq <= maxDataSeq`)**: ADOPT into BOTH cursors and return `AckOutcomeAdopted`. The dispatcher then calls `wal.MarkAcked(serverGen, serverSeq)` per the helper-vs-dispatcher split above. No anomaly log.

  The first-apply branch is generation-agnostic in the sense that ANY `serverGen` is acceptable - there is no `persistedAck.Generation` to compare against - but BOTH the per-gen data-bearing accessor (`WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen)`) AND the cross-gen lower-data accessor (`HasDataBelowGeneration(serverGen)`) gate the adopt. The Operational signals subsection notes the operator story for repeated cold-start seed anomalies (e.g. wiped WAL + persistent server ack-state) - see "Cold-start seed anomalies" below.
- **Same generation, server > local (`server_gen == local persistedAck.gen` AND `server_seq > local persistedAck.seq`)**: ADVANCE BOTH cursors and return `AckOutcomeAdopted` (the dispatcher then calls `wal.MarkAcked(serverGen, serverSeq)` per the helper-vs-dispatcher split above). The clamp helper additionally guards against fabricated futures by requiring `server_seq <= wal.HighWaterSequence()` (the highest sequence ever written in the current generation); a higher-than-WAL claim takes the Anomaly path (see "True anomaly" sub-case 1). This is the normal, healthy ack-advance path.
- **Same generation, server < local (`server_gen == local persistedAck.gen` AND `server_seq < local persistedAck.seq`)**: SET `remoteReplayCursor = (serverGen, serverSeq)`; LEAVE `persistedAck` UNCHANGED; return `AckOutcomeResendNeeded`. The dispatcher does NOT call `wal.MarkAcked` (per the helper-vs-dispatcher split above - `wal.MarkAcked` is only invoked on `AckOutcomeAdopted`). This is the legitimate stale-watermark recovery path. The next replay window opens at `serverSeq + 1` and re-sends the gap to the server. Log INFO (NOT WARN) with both tuples (`server_gen`, `server_seq`, `local_persisted_gen`, `local_persisted_seq`) - this is normal recovery, not an anomaly. The persistedAck stays put because the WAL has already GC'd or may GC at any time the segments at that watermark; the in-memory mirror MUST stay in lock-step with the on-disk meta.json so a future restart re-seeds correctly. Increment `wtp_resend_needed_total` (a counter - see Task 22b and the Operational signals subsection below).
- **Same generation, equal (`server_gen == local persistedAck.gen` AND `server_seq == local persistedAck.seq`)**: no-op on both cursors.
- **Higher generation with local WAL having emitted RecordData in that generation (`server_gen > local persistedAck.gen` AND `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(server_gen)` returns `(maxDataSeq, true)` AND `server_seq <= maxDataSeq`)**: ADVANCE BOTH cursors and return `AckOutcomeAdopted` (the dispatcher then calls `wal.MarkAcked(serverGen, serverSeq)` per the helper-vs-dispatcher split above). This is the normal cross-generation ack-advance path: the client's writer rolled to `server_gen` (emitting RecordData), the client sent those records, and the server has now durably acked through `(server_gen, server_seq)` - but only advanced `persistedAck` on disk through the previous generation. The WAL's `MarkAcked` already supports monotonic cross-generation advancement (see `wal.MarkAcked`'s `advance` predicate - `gen > w.ackHighGen || (gen == w.ackHighGen && seq > w.ackHighSeq)`). No anomaly, no WARN; this is a legitimate restart/reconnect case. The per-gen data-bearing accessor is the SOLE proof gate for this branch - neither `wal.HighWaterSequence()` (which only reports the current-generation tip) nor `wal.WrittenHighGeneration()` (which is seeded from segment headers BEFORE any data lands) is sufficient.
- **Lower generation (`server_gen < local persistedAck.gen`, any server_seq)**: take the Anomaly path with `AnomalyReason="stale_generation"`. NEITHER cursor moves; the helper returns `AckOutcomeAnomaly` (the dispatcher therefore does NOT call `wal.MarkAcked` per the helper-vs-dispatcher split above). Lower-generation `ResendNeeded` is **deliberately out of scope** for this phase (see the §"Effective-ack tuple and clamp" rationale immediately above).
- **Higher generation with WAL having opened a SegmentHeader for that generation but never having emitted RecordData (`server_gen > local persistedAck.gen` AND `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(server_gen)` returns `(_, false)`)**: take the Anomaly path with `AnomalyReason="unwritten_generation"`. NEITHER cursor moves; the helper returns `AckOutcomeAnomaly` (no `wal.MarkAcked` call from the dispatcher). The writer rolled into the server's generation (its segment header is on disk and `w.highGen` reflects it), but no RecordData has been written there yet - this is the round-11 SAFETY case: admitting the ack would let `wal.MarkAcked` accept a fabricated tuple and immediately make all lower-generation segments reclaimable under lexicographic GC (`segmentFullyAckedLocked` in wal.go), silently dropping unsent history.
- **Higher generation with server seq beyond the per-gen data-bearing high-water (`server_gen > local persistedAck.gen` AND `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(server_gen)` returns `(maxDataSeq, true)` AND `server_seq > maxDataSeq`)**: take the Anomaly path with `AnomalyReason="server_ack_exceeds_local_data"`. NEITHER cursor moves; the helper returns `AckOutcomeAnomaly` (no `wal.MarkAcked` call from the dispatcher). The writer has emitted RecordData in the server's generation, but the server's claimed sequence is past anything the writer actually emitted - same safety class as `unwritten_generation`: admitting the ack would let lex GC discard surviving lower-generation segments holding unsent records.

**True anomaly (every case here produces a rate-limited WARN; local cursors are kept unchanged in all sub-cases).** Under the two-cursor model the anomaly bucket covers FIVE disjoint shapes (round-12 expansion of the round-11 four-shape taxonomy: round-11's `beyond_wal_high_water_seq` reason was renamed to `server_ack_exceeds_local_seq` so the same-gen branch shares the cross-gen "exceeds local data" naming; round-12 Finding 4 added `wal_read_failure` to surface non-nil errors from the per-gen accessor instead of silently treating them as ok=false; the round-9 `future_generation` reason was earlier split in round-11 into `unwritten_generation` / `server_ack_exceeds_local_data`); all of them KEEP local cursors unchanged and emit a rate-limited WARN with FULL tuple context (`server_gen`, `server_seq`, `local_persisted_gen`, `local_persisted_seq`, `wal_written_data_high_seq`, `wal_written_data_high_ok`).

1. **`serverGen == local persistedAck.gen` AND `serverSeq > wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen).seq`** - same generation, sequence beyond anything the WAL has ever appended in this generation. The server is ahead of physically-emitted history; this is the classic anomaly shape and is most often a test/replay misconfiguration or a server-side state corruption. Increment `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason="server_ack_exceeds_local_seq"}` (round-12 RENAMED from `beyond_wal_high_water_seq`; the same-gen branch now uses the same `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(server.gen)` predicate as the cross-gen branch so both share a single source of truth for the "server seq exceeds local data" shape).
2. **`serverGen < local persistedAck.gen`** - server is on an older generation than the client's persistedAck. The client cannot legitimately replay across generations downward under the WAL Reader API today (sequence-keyed reader, sequences reset on every generation roll, single-`Generation` `LossRecord`), so a stale-generation server tuple cannot be expressed as a `ResendNeeded` outcome. This is the "stale-server crossed a key/generation rotation" shape - the operator-visible signal is that the server has not yet caught up to a SessionUpdate the client already advanced past. Increment `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason="stale_generation"}`.
3. **`serverGen > local persistedAck.gen` AND `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen)` returns `(_, false, nil)`** - server claims a generation the local WAL has opened a SegmentHeader for (the writer rolled into it and `w.highGen` reflects it) but never emitted RecordData in. Round-11 SAFETY case: under the round-10 `WrittenHighGeneration()` design the helper would Adopt and `wal.MarkAcked` would accept any tuple in this generation, immediately making lower-generation segments reclaimable under lex GC and silently dropping unsent history. The per-gen data-bearing accessor blocks this. Increment `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason="unwritten_generation"}`.
4. **`serverGen > local persistedAck.gen` AND `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen)` returns `(maxDataSeq, true, nil)` AND `serverSeq > maxDataSeq`** - server claims a sequence beyond anything the writer has actually emitted in the server's generation. Same safety class as `unwritten_generation`. Increment `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason="server_ack_exceeds_local_data"}`.
5. **Any branch where `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen)` itself returns a non-nil error (round-12 Finding 4 NEW)** - the WAL accessor failed for an I/O reason (disk error, file race, etc.). The helper surfaces this as Anomaly so that (a) cursors stay UNCHANGED - the next ack-bearing frame retries the read; and (b) operators get a discoverable signal via `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason="wal_read_failure"}` instead of a silent `ok=false` fallback that would have classified the frame as `unwritten_generation` and lost the I/O failure information. Increment `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason="wal_read_failure"}`.

NOTE: a higher-generation server tuple where `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen) == (maxDataSeq, true, nil) AND serverSeq <= maxDataSeq` is NOT an anomaly - it is the legitimate Adopted case described above (the client wrote RecordData up to `maxDataSeq` in `serverGen` and the server is now acking within that range).

In all five cases `t.persistedAck`, `t.remoteReplayCursor`, and the WAL meta are left untouched (the helper makes no in-memory mutation, and the dispatcher skips `wal.MarkAcked` because the helper returned `AckOutcomeAnomaly`). The clamp helper returns the typed `Anomaly` outcome (see the helper signature below). Most production deployments will never hit these cases; if they do, the WARN log is the trigger for operator investigation. Lower-generation `ResendNeeded` is **deliberately out of scope** for this phase per the §"Effective-ack tuple and clamp" rationale above - the WAL Reader API would need a `(gen, seq)` start tuple and `LossRecord` would need a multi-generation range to express a lower-generation replay cleanly, and neither change is in the WTP client phase scope.

**Loss between replay cursor and persisted ack.** When the server presents a lex-lower tuple **with the same generation as `persistedAck`** AND the WAL has already GC'd the segments holding records `(remoteReplayCursor, persistedAck]` (because GC was driven by an earlier higher ack), the data the server is asking for is permanently gone. The transport detects this BEFORE opening the replay reader: it queries `wal.WAL.EarliestDataSequence(gen uint32) (seq uint64, ok bool, err error)` (a new accessor introduced in Task 14a - returns the lowest user RecordData sequence still on disk **for the requested generation**; `ok=false` means the WAL has no surviving RecordData in that generation; `err != nil` is reserved for I/O failures the WAL chose to surface and is treated as fatal by the caller - the caller propagates the error to the state machine which forces a reconnect rather than opening the reader at the wrong position). The accessor is **generation-aware** (round-12 Finding 1 - round-11's generation-implicit signature was unsafe). Sequences reset on every generation roll AND higher-generation segments can coexist on disk while lower-generation segments are GC'd, so a generation-implicit accessor would surface a *later* generation's low sequence as evidence the *replay* generation's gap is intact - silently masking `ack_regression_after_gc` whenever the writer rolls past the GC'd generation. The Reader is opened **generation-scoped** as well (Task 14b - round-13 Findings 1+2 introduced `wal.NewReader(ReaderOptions{Generation, Start})` so the iteration domain is constrained to the replay generation; the prior sequence-only API would have iterated past the generation boundary into newer-gen segments, which is incorrect when replaying a same-gen window because newer-gen RecordData is NOT part of the server's expected replay stream and is owned by the Live state). The *gap detector* is generation-scoped: the helper passes `remoteReplayCursor.gen` (the generation being replayed; equivalently `persistedAck.gen` because the same-generation invariant holds by the time `computeReplayStart` runs) and the accessor returns the earliest sequence among RecordData in that generation only. Let `gapStart = remoteReplayCursor.seq + 1`. The transport routes through the canonical 4-case decision tree below (the helper `computeReplayStart` in Task 15.1 implements this):

| Case | `EarliestDataSequence(persistedAck.gen)` | Additional condition | `prefixLoss` | `readerStart` | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A. Partial GC | `(earliest, true, nil)` | `earliest > gapStart` | `&LossRecord{FromSequence: gapStart, ToSequence: earliest-1, Generation: persistedAck.gen, Reason: "ack_regression_after_gc"}` | `earliest` | Some surviving RecordData remains in the replay generation; the gap `[gapStart, earliest-1]` was GC'd. Synthesize a marker for the GC'd prefix; open the reader at the first surviving record. |
| B. No gap | `(earliest, true, nil)` | `earliest <= gapStart` | `nil` | `gapStart` | The server's tuple is still on disk in the replay generation. No loss to emit; open the reader at the normal replay start. |
| C. Fully GC'd, server regressed below persisted | `(0, false, nil)` | `gapStart <= persistedAck.seq` (i.e. `remoteReplayCursor.seq < persistedAck.seq`) | `&LossRecord{FromSequence: gapStart, ToSequence: persistedAck.seq, Generation: persistedAck.gen, Reason: "ack_regression_after_gc"}` | `persistedAck.seq + 1` | The replay generation has been fully GC'd (zero RecordData remains in that generation) AND the server's cursor is behind the persisted ack - the entire range `[gapStart, persistedAck.seq]` is unrecoverable. Synthesize the marker; open the reader at `persistedAck.seq + 1` (the smallest sequence we can prove is durably acked). The server's cursor `remoteReplayCursor.seq` cannot drive reader positioning when the server is behind, so opening at `persistedAck.seq + 1` is the canonical rule (round-12 Finding 3 - round-11's `gapStart` was inconsistent with the helper). The reader yields zero records in this generation because everything is GC'd, but the synthesized PrefixLoss is what the server needs. This is the "fully-GC'd, server-regressed-below-persisted" case round-9 silently dropped; round-10 surfaces it. |
| D. Fully GC'd, server at-or-past persisted | `(0, false, nil)` | `gapStart > persistedAck.seq` | `nil` | `gapStart` | The server's cursor equals or exceeds the persisted ack tip; the replay generation is empty because everything has been acked-and-GC'd in step. No regression → no loss to emit. (When `gapStart == persistedAck.seq + 1` this is the steady-state reconnect; when `gapStart > persistedAck.seq + 1` the server is ahead of persisted ack - an Anomaly the helper has already classified as `server_ack_exceeds_local_seq` (round-12 RENAMED from `beyond_wal_high_water_seq`), but the loss-emit path is still a no-op.) |

**Replay invariants under generation rolls (round-12 Missing A; refined by round-13 Findings 1+2).** Same-generation replay is supported even when later-generation WAL data is already on disk. The replay reader (and `computeReplayStart`'s `EarliestDataSequence(gen)` call) is scoped to the generation being replayed: the accessor returns the lowest RecordData sequence in *that* generation only, AND the reader iterates within *that* generation only via the round-13 `wal.NewReader(ReaderOptions{Generation, Start})` API (Task 14b). The reader's `Next()`/`TryNext()` return `io.EOF` when iteration crosses out of the requested generation - newer-gen RecordData is owned by the Live state's reader (which opens against the writer's current generation) and MUST NOT leak into the replay window, otherwise the server would receive records that are not part of its expected resend stream. A higher-generation roll that has already landed RecordData on disk does NOT influence the gap detector - it cannot mask a fully-GC'd lower generation, and it cannot artificially partial-GC a generation whose own segments are intact. Conversely the higher-generation segments remain available for subsequent state cycles (the Live state will reach them through the normal Reader path once the replay window completes), so generation-scoping the gap detector AND the reader does not orphan any data. The Replayer's tail tracker is a `(gen, seq)` tuple (round-13 Task 14b) so cross-generation `lastEmittedSeq` confusion is impossible at the type level - `LastReplayedSequence()` returns the tuple, and the Live state seeds its reader from `(remoteReplayCursor.gen, max(remoteReplayCursor.seq, replayer.lastEmittedSeq))` only when the generations match. This invariant is the contract the round-12 Finding 1 + round-13 Findings 1+2 fixes lock in.

When the loss range is non-empty (cases A and C), the transport synthesizes the `wal.LossRecord` **in memory** and passes it to the Replayer via `Replayer.PrefixLoss` (or equivalent constructor option) BEFORE the Replayer opens its first batch. The Replayer's first batch surfaces this loss marker as the first record so it reaches the server through the same `TransportLoss` propagation path the existing CRC-corruption / overflow markers use (per Task 13). The synthetic loss is **NOT persisted to the WAL** - `wal.AppendLoss` writes to the live tail (out of order vs. the surviving on-disk data) and latches the WAL into fatal on I/O failure. Neither failure mode is acceptable for a per-reconnect transient signal: in-memory synthesis keeps the loss marker ordered correctly relative to the replay window AND avoids the WAL fatal-latch surface entirely. The transport increments `wtp_ack_regression_loss_total` (a counter - see Task 22b) at **emit time**, NOT compute time: the Replayer's `OnPrefixLossEmitted` callback (Round-13 Finding 5) fires synchronously inside the FIRST `NextBatch()` call AFTER the synthetic record has been appended as record[0] of the batch, so the counter reflects "marker landed in a batch the receiver consumed" rather than "marker was scheduled to be consumed". This is permanent loss - the gap is unrecoverable from local state - but the protocol surface (`TransportLoss`) makes it visible to operators rather than silently swallowing the records.

**Operational signals subsection.** Two operator-visible counters surface ack-related misbehaviour and warrant alert rules:

- `wtp_resend_needed_total` (counter) - incremented every time `applyServerAckTuple` returns `ResendNeeded`. A sustained rate above ~5/min indicates the server is repeatedly presenting stale ack tuples, which usually points at server-side ack-persistence issues (lost durability, restart loss, or replication lag). Operators should investigate the server's ack-watermark store before chasing client-side issues. Steady-state expected rate is zero - `ResendNeeded` is the legitimate stale-recovery path, not the steady-state path.
- `wtp_ack_regression_loss_total` (counter) - incremented every time the transport's Replayer surfaces an `ack_regression_after_gc` loss marker as the first record of its first batch. Any non-zero rate is operator-visible: it means a server presented a stale ack tuple AND the WAL had already GC'd the requested records. The data is permanently gone; the marker exists to make that visible to the server. Recurring increments suggest aggressive WAL `MaxTotalBytes` tuning relative to server ack lag, or a server that consistently lags far behind the client.
  - **Counting semantics (round-13 Finding 5: emit-time, NOT compute-time).** The counter is incremented EXACTLY ONCE per batch that successfully emits a synthetic PrefixLoss as record[0]. The emit site is the `ReplayerOptions.OnPrefixLossEmitted` callback - fired synchronously by the Replayer inside its FIRST `NextBatch()` call AFTER the synthetic `wal.LossRecord{Reason: "ack_regression_after_gc"}` has been appended as record[0] of the batch AND AFTER the in-Replayer `prefixLossEmitted` gate has flipped to true (defense-in-depth against re-entry). The Replaying state's reader-open path wires this callback as `func() { t.metrics.IncAckRegressionLoss() }` when constructing the Replayer (Task 15.1 Step 1b.5). **This relocates the increment from the prior compute-time site (round-12: "IMMEDIATELY AFTER `transport.NewReplayer(...)` SUCCEEDS and BEFORE the Replayer produces its first batch") to the emit-time site so the counter reflects "marker landed in a batch the receiver consumed" rather than "marker was scheduled to be consumed".** The counter is NOT incremented when (a) `computeReplayStart` returns `prefixLoss == nil` (cases B/D of the §"Loss between replay cursor and persisted ack" 4-case table; the Replayer guards the callback invocation with `if r.opts.PrefixLoss != nil`), (b) `computeReplayStart` returns a non-nil err (the `wal_read_failure` Anomaly path or any other I/O failure - no Replayer materialises so the callback never fires), (c) the Replayer is constructed with `PrefixLoss == nil` (the Replayer never re-derives the marker on its own; the callback is never fired), (d) the Replaying state aborts after constructing the Replayer but BEFORE the Replayer's first `NextBatch` returns successfully (the callback is invoked synchronously at the end of `NextBatch` so any pre-emit failure aborts before increment), or (e) `OnPrefixLossEmitted` is left nil by the caller (the callback is nil-safe so unit tests can construct a Replayer without the metric dependency; production wiring MUST set it). In other words: this counter strictly counts "ack-regression-after-GC loss markers EMITTED INTO A BATCH BY THE REPLAYER" - strictly tighter than the round-12 "scheduled into the wire path" definition. A nonzero divergence between this counter and the server-side `replay_loss_marker_total` family would indicate either (i) a transport bug dropping markers on close (the marker emitted but the batch never crossed the wire), or (ii) a server-side classification bug; either is operator-actionable.
- `wtp_anomalous_ack_total{reason="*"}` (counter, **cold-start seed anomalies subsection - round-15 Finding 1**) - incremented every time `applyServerAckTuple` returns an Anomaly outcome. The five reasons (`stale_generation`, `unwritten_generation`, `server_ack_exceeds_local_data`, `server_ack_exceeds_local_seq`, `wal_read_failure`) are documented in the §"True anomaly" sub-section above. The **cold-start seed** sub-case (a non-zero rate observed *immediately after process restart with `t.persistedAckPresent == false`*) deserves its own operator playbook because it cannot be explained by any of the steady-state narratives - the local WAL was just (re-)opened and the first server tuple landed in the first-apply branch of the clamp, which round-15 Finding 1 hardened to validate the server tuple against `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen)` BEFORE adopting. Two distinct on-call narratives produce a sustained cold-start anomaly burst:
  1. **Wiped or restored WAL + persistent server ack-state.** The agent's WAL directory was deleted, restored from a snapshot, or migrated to a different host - but the server still remembers the *previous* incarnation's ack watermark. The first SessionAck after reconnect carries the server's stale tuple, which lands beyond the freshly-rebuilt WAL's data tip and is rejected as `unwritten_generation` (or `server_ack_exceeds_local_data` if the writer has begun emitting in `serverGen` but not as far as `serverSeq`). Without the round-15 validation gate the helper would have wholesale-adopted this stale tuple, and the next `wal.MarkAcked` would have advanced the on-disk watermark past surviving records on the very first ack - silently dropping the rebuild's first batches under lex GC. The repeating-burst signature is: every reconnect the same generation/sequence is rejected with the same reason. **Operator remediation:** force a server-side session reset (clears server ack-state) so the next cold-start sees `serverSeq == 0` and the vacuous-zero adopt branch fires cleanly. The agent then resumes from the WAL's actual data tip rather than from a fabricated server position. If session reset is not available, escalate to forced session-rotation (new SessionID), which moves the agent off the persistent server-side ack state by switching identities - the cold-start safety check (§"Cold-start seed safety / stale meta detection") will quarantine the old WAL automatically.
  2. **WAL read failure during seed window.** A burst of `wal_read_failure` reasons immediately after restart usually points at a transient disk-level issue (NAS that has not finished mounting, in-flight `fsck`, IOMMU passthrough timing) - the first few `wal.WrittenDataHighWater(serverGen)` calls return non-nil errors. Cursors stay UNCHANGED across the burst, so the next ack-bearing frame retries against a (presumably) recovered WAL. If the burst persists past the disk-recovery window (≥30s) operators MUST escalate to disk diagnostics; the helper does NOT auto-quarantine on persistent `wal_read_failure` because the failure is transport-side observable (no on-disk corruption signature), and silently quarantining could destroy good data on a transient disk-availability blip.

  Steady-state expected rate for ALL five reasons combined is zero. A cold-start burst of `unwritten_generation` or `server_ack_exceeds_local_data` with no corresponding WAL identity-mismatch quarantine event in the same window is the single highest-confidence signal of "agent and server disagree about persistent state without the operator having intentionally reset either side" - operators MUST treat this as a paging-class signal (it represents either a silent restore-from-snapshot or a server-side ack-store corruption, both of which destabilise the session if left unaddressed). A burst that *does* coincide with a quarantine event is the documented v0 → v2 migration path or the documented identity-rotation path and self-resolves on the next session establishment.

**Cost bound for reconnect-time replay scan (round-15 Finding 3; round-16 Finding 2 update; round-16 Missing - span/surviving-count disambiguation; round-17 Findings 1+2+Missing - wraparound guard, baseline ranges, observables; round-18 Findings 1+2+3 - observables corrected to match what is actually wired today vs. proposed future work; round-19 Findings 1+2 - fresh-WAL meta.json absence + anomaly WARN ≠ replay-span proxy; round-20 Finding 1 - AckRecorded invariant scoped to MarkAcked production caller, not all WriteMeta).** The `computeReplayPlan` orchestrator (Task 15.1) iterates `for gen := persistedAck.Generation + 1; gen <= wal.HighGeneration() && gen > persistedAck.Generation; gen++` and calls `wal.HasReplayableRecords(gen)` on each generation in the range. The trailing `gen > persistedAck.Generation` term is a uint32 wraparound guard for the degenerate case `persistedAck.Generation == math.MaxUint32`: the `gen + 1` increment would underflow the uint32 to `0` and the loop would re-enter the entire range from below, replaying every generation on disk; the guard short-circuits to zero iterations instead. Operationally this case is unreachable (4.3 billion generation rolls would require a key-rotation cadence orders of magnitude faster than any deployment), but the guard is mandatory for type-level safety and is part of the canonical loop shape. The cost is **O(span)** where `span = wal.HighGeneration() − persistedAck.Generation` (zero when the wraparound guard fires) - i.e., the iteration count is the **range of generation numbers**, NOT the count of generations that still have files on disk and NOT the count of generations that survive the `HasReplayableRecords` filter. The two quantities track different things and have different healthy ranges:

- **Span on reconnect** is typically **0-1**: 0 in steady-state when the agent reconnected with no new generations rolled (`persistedAck.Generation == wal.HighGeneration()`, common when the disconnect was short relative to the rotation cadence), and 1 when a single key rotation occurred during the disconnect window. A span > 1 implies multiple rotations during one disconnect; a span > 10 is the alert threshold below.
- **Surviving-count** is typically **1-3** independent of span: one current writer's generation plus at most a couple of older partial-GC'd generations whose data still exists on disk. Surviving-count is a slowly-changing function of GC tuning (`MaxTotalBytes` retention) and steady-state ack lag, NOT a per-reconnect transient.

These ranges diverge under one specific pathology: a long-disconnected agent whose writer has rolled the generation counter forward many times (e.g., via key rotations) while GC has been pruning older generations from the middle of the range. Concrete example: `persistedAck.Generation = 10` and `wal.HighGeneration() = 20` with generations 11-13 fully GC'd and only 14, 15, 20 surviving on disk → span = 10 (the loop calls `HasReplayableRecords` ten times), surviving-count = 3, plan-stage count = 3 (the GC'd middle generations short-circuit at the `if !haveAny { continue }` branch). The bound that matters for runtime cost is the span, because every iteration pays a map lookup whether the generation survives or not. `wal.HasReplayableRecords` performs a small in-memory map lookup against the WAL's per-generation any-payload set (`internal/store/watchtower/wal/wal.go` - `w.perGenAnyReplayable`, updated by `Append`, `AppendLoss`, and the `Open` recovery scan, pruned by GC) so each call is O(1) memory read with no disk I/O. The probe accessor is `HasReplayableRecords` rather than `WrittenDataHighWater` because round-16 Finding 2 requires loss-only generations (a generation that holds only a `RecordLoss` marker, e.g. one written by an overflow GC mid-session) to receive a replay stage - `WrittenDataHighWater` would return `(_, false, nil)` for such a generation and silently drop it from the plan, leaving the loss marker un-emitted. Pathological span (a long-running agent that has accumulated a wide gap between `persistedAck.Generation` and `wal.HighGeneration()` after many rotations and partial GCs) would still complete the scan in well under 1ms because the per-generation cost is a hash lookup, but if a deployment ever sees `span > 10` consistently the WAL retention/GC tuning is misconfigured relative to rotation cadence (typically `MaxTotalBytes` set far higher than the server's ack-lag budget, OR a key-rotation policy that triggers far more frequently than the reconnect cadence) and operators should investigate independently - the surviving-count staying at 1-3 in such a deployment confirms the issue is span growth from rotation cadence rather than a per-stage cost regression.

**Concrete observables for span and surviving-count.** Neither quantity is currently emitted as a metric. Today only `persistedAck.Generation` has a stable on-disk surface; `wal.HighGeneration()` and surviving-count have NO built-in operator-facing observable in the current tree. Dedicated metrics are proposed as future work - `wtp_replay_plan_span` (sampled at each reconnect) and a surviving-count gauge would both be reasonable additions to Task 22b's metrics expansion. The current path:

- `persistedAck.Generation` - read `meta.json` in the WAL directory. **Fresh-WAL caveat:** `meta.json` is written exclusively by `MarkAcked` (see `internal/store/watchtower/wal/wal.go::WAL.MarkAcked` - the sole production caller of `WriteMeta`); on a WAL directory where no ack has ever been persisted the file is **absent**, not present-with-zero. The operator procedure splits accordingly:
    - **`meta.json` absent** → no ack has ever been recorded; `persistedAck.Generation` is implicitly 0 with `persistedAckPresent == false`. The reconnect path will route through the first-apply branch.
    - **`meta.json` present** → run `cat $WAL_DIR/meta.json | jq .ack_high_watermark_gen` (the field name is `ack_high_watermark_gen` per `internal/store/watchtower/wal/meta.go` - the Meta struct's `AckHighWatermarkGen` field). The current production write path (`MarkAcked → WriteMeta` in `wal.go`, the sole production caller) sets `AckRecorded: true`, so a present file written by production code always reflects a real persisted ack - there is no present-with-zero ambiguity to disambiguate via `ack_recorded`. (The `WriteMeta` function itself does NOT enforce `AckRecorded: true` - only the production caller does; in-tree tests write meta directly with `AckRecorded` left at the zero value, and any future writer that seeds identity without an ack would fall in the same category. Operators MUST therefore still consult `ack_recorded` if any non-`MarkAcked` writer exists in the deployment, but for the v2 files written exclusively by today's production code the field is invariably true when the file exists.)
- `wal.HighGeneration()` - **NOT externally surfaced today.** The WAL package has no logger and emits no event on generation rolls; the value is only available via the in-process accessor (`internal/store/watchtower/wal/wal.go::WAL.HighGeneration()`). Operators MUST derive it by scanning every segment header in the WAL directory (each `SegmentHeader.Generation` carries the writer's generation at seal time) and taking the max - there is no clean filesystem command because segment files are named by index only (`internal/store/watchtower/wal/segment.go::segmentName(uint64)`, not generation). Until a dedicated log/metric is implemented, span cannot be derived from operator-facing surfaces alone.
- **Derived span:** subtract `wal.HighGeneration()` and `persistedAck.Generation` per the bullets above. **There is no log-based proxy for replay-scan span today.** The Anomaly WARN family emitted by `ackSessionAck` (per the §"True anomaly" sub-section above) carries `local_persisted_gen` (= `persistedAck.Generation`) and `server_gen` (= the incoming server ack tuple's generation, NOT `wal.HighGeneration()`); the gap `server_gen − local_persisted_gen` is a **server/local ack-divergence signal**, not a replay-span proxy. A server-side ack-store divergence or corruption can produce an arbitrarily large logged gap even when `wal.HighGeneration() == persistedAck.Generation` and the actual replay scan iterates zero times. Conversely, a deployment with a long-disconnected agent (large local span) but a server that has not yet attempted reconnect will not log any anomaly WARNs at all, so the absence of WARN bursts does NOT prove span ≈ 0 either. Treat the WARN family as a divergence detector and use the meta.json + segment-header procedure above when an actual span measurement is needed. **Coverage caveat for the WARN family itself:** `ackSessionAck` is the only emitter wired today; the analogous BatchAck and ServerHeartbeat handlers will land in Tasks 17/18/22 and will inherit the same WARN field schema. Until those tasks ship, only the SessionAck path on reconnect surfaces the divergence fields, so an agent that holds a long Live session and never reconnects will produce no divergence observability through the WARN path.
- **Surviving-count** has NO built-in observable today. Operators MUST read every segment header (each header carries `Generation`) and count distinct values; there is no per-generation log, metric, or debug subcommand. A dedicated `wtp_wal_surviving_generations` gauge is proposed as future Task 22b work. (The unrelated `wtp_wal_quarantine_total` counter - itself a Round 9/10 plan addition not yet in code - tracks identity-mismatch quarantines per the §"Quarantine policy" subsection; it has no semantic relationship to GC retention or surviving-count and MUST NOT be used as a proxy.)

The scan runs once per reconnect, on the same goroutine as the reader-open path, BEFORE any Replayer is constructed; it does not block the receive goroutine and adds no measurable latency to the steady-state Live path.

The two fields of EACH cursor move TOGETHER or neither does. Mixing local-seq with server-gen (or vice versa) creates an impossible state under the WAL's lex-`(gen, seq)` GC semantics - segments are sorted and reclaimed by lex tuple, so a half-applied server watermark would either silently retain unacked segments (data wedge) or silently drop in-flight segments (data loss). The clamp is type-enforced via `applyServerAckTuple`; no other code path advances either cursor. `SessionUpdate` is NOT an acknowledgement - it is a control frame for key/generation rotation per §"Acknowledgement model" above; it never advances either cursor.

`wal.Meta.AckRecorded == false` is a legitimate state, not a bug: it simply means "no ack has ever been persisted for this WAL directory." No production writer creates `AckRecorded=false` explicitly; the absence of `MarkAcked` calls leaves the field implicitly false on a fresh WAL. The cold-start seed maps it directly to `t.persistedAckPresent=false`, routing the next SessionAck through the first-apply branch.

The state-handler cases READ the appropriate cursor:

- **Replaying** is a **multi-stage** state. The state handler asks the clamp helper for a `[]ReplayStage` (one stage per WAL generation that holds **any replayable payload - RecordData OR a loss marker**, in strictly ascending generation order, starting at `persistedAck.Generation`). Each stage carries `(Generation uint32, StartSeq uint64, PrefixLoss *wal.LossRecord)` and is processed sequentially:
  1. **Open one Reader per stage**, scoped to the stage's generation: `wal.NewReader(ReaderOptions{Generation: stage.Generation, Start: stage.StartSeq})`. The first stage's `StartSeq` comes from `computeReplayStart` (the canonical `remoteReplayCursor + 1` adjusted for the 4-case decision tree); every subsequent stage opens at `StartSeq = 0` because a newer generation's records were never acked under the older `persistedAck` so the entire generation must be replayed. The Reader is generation-scoped (Task 14b) so it returns `io.EOF` at the generation boundary - no leak into newer generations within a single Reader.
  2. **PrefixLoss is first-stage-only.** Only `stages[0].PrefixLoss` MAY be non-nil (it carries the synthetic `ack_regression_after_gc` marker computed by `computeReplayStart`); subsequent stages set `PrefixLoss = nil` because the loss is bounded to the original replay generation under the same-generation invariant of the §"Loss between replay cursor and persisted ack" 4-case table. The Replayer wired around the per-stage Reader receives `stages[i].PrefixLoss` via `ReplayerOptions.PrefixLoss` and emits the marker as record[0] of its first batch (Task 16); the `OnPrefixLossEmitted` callback fires the `wtp_ack_regression_loss_total` increment exactly once per state cycle (round-13 Finding 5 emit-time semantics).
  3. **Ack source during replay.** Inbound `BatchAck` and `SessionAck` continue to flow through `applyServerAckTuple` while replay is in progress. Both cursors (`persistedAck`, `remoteReplayCursor`) MAY advance during replay if the server is acking records the Replayer just shipped, but the state handler does NOT re-derive its `[]ReplayStage` mid-flight - the staged plan is computed ONCE at state entry and is not re-clamped on every ack. This avoids a thrash where the receiver advances `persistedAck`, the state handler recomputes stages, and the new stage list disagrees with the in-flight Replayer's position. The clamp's `Anomaly` outcome during replay is logged identically to the steady-state path (rate-limited WARN, no cursor movement) - it does not abort replay.
  4. **Transition to Live ONLY after the last stage drains.** When the final stage's Reader returns `io.EOF` AND the Replayer's final batch has been sent (and ack'd or queued), the state handler transitions to Live. The Live state opens its OWN Reader at `wal.NewReader(ReaderOptions{Generation: writer.CurrentGeneration(), Start: max(remoteReplayCursor.seq + 1, replayer.LastReplayedSequence().seq + 1)})` per the existing tuple-aware seed rule. Critically, transitioning to Live BEFORE the multi-stage replay completes would skip the later-gen backlog: under the round-15 Finding 2 fix the orchestrator emits a stage per generation that holds data, and Live's Reader is scoped to the writer's current generation only, so any pre-Live-transition gap in the older generations would be permanently dropped from the wire (the records remain on disk, but no state ever re-reads them after the state machine moves on). The round-16 Finding 2 fix extends this guarantee to **loss-only generations**: any generation with a loss marker on disk (e.g., a `RecordLoss` written by an overflow GC mid-session) but zero `RecordData` MUST still receive a replay stage so the Replayer surfaces the loss marker on the wire - `wal.WrittenDataHighWater` would return `(_, false, nil)` for such a generation and silently drop it from the plan, so the orchestrator probes `wal.HasReplayableRecords(gen)` instead (any payload - `RecordData` or `RecordLoss`). The "transition only after the last stage" rule is what makes the multi-stage backlog actually reach the server.
  5. **Failure handling.** Any per-stage Reader-open failure or per-stage Replayer error aborts Replaying with a typed error (per the existing Task 16 contract: state machine drops to Connecting and reconnects). The next reconnect's `computeReplayPlan` call re-derives the stage list from current WAL state - this is safe because the in-memory cursors only advance via `applyServerAckTuple`, so a reconnect mid-stage cannot lose ground. The clamp's first-apply branch is NOT re-taken across reconnects within the same process lifetime (the `persistedAckPresent` flag stays true once set, and `wal.MarkAcked` keeps the disk meta in sync).
- **Live** opens its WAL `Reader` at `max(remoteReplayCursor + 1, replayerLastEmittedSeq + 1)` - the same cursor, but bounded by where the replayer left off so we do not re-send records the replayer already shipped. Live runs against ONE Reader scoped to the writer's current generation; generation rolls during Live re-open the Reader against the new generation (Task 17 / Live state lifecycle).

Neither state advances either cursor, and neither re-clamps. The clamp lives in the SessionAck / BatchAck / ServerHeartbeat handlers, not the state-handler cases.

### Frame validation and forward compatibility

Schema-valid but semantically invalid frames (e.g., `EventBatch.body` unset, `compression == COMPRESSION_UNSPECIFIED`, `algorithm == HASH_ALGORITHM_UNSPECIFIED`) are protocol-level errors. Receivers MUST:

1. Drop the offending frame.
2. Increment `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason}` with the appropriate frame-validation reason. The reasons split into two categories with disjoint provenance:

   - **Validator-emitted reasons** (proto-side `wtpv1.ValidationReason` constants, returned by `ValidateEventBatch`/`ValidateSessionInit` as `*wtpv1.ValidationError`): `event_batch_body_unset`, `event_batch_compression_unspecified`, `event_batch_compression_mismatch` (uncompressed body declares non-NONE compression, or compressed_payload body declares NONE), `session_init_algorithm_unspecified`, `payload_too_large` (compressed_payload exceeds `MaxCompressedPayloadBytes`, matches `wtpv1.ErrPayloadTooLarge`), and `unknown` (forward-compat catch-all RESERVED for the validator-emitted `ReasonUnknown` case - a new oneof discriminator added to the proto schema before `validate.go` is updated to classify it; see the "MUST return `*ValidationError`" contract below). These reasons MUST appear in BOTH the proto-side `wtpv1.ValidationReason` enum and the metrics-side `WTPInvalidFrameReason` enum, with byte-equal string values so receivers can do `metrics.WTPInvalidFrameReason(ve.Reason)` safely.
   - **Metrics-only reasons** (incremented by code paths downstream of the validator, with no proto-side counterpart): `decompress_error` - incremented by the streaming-decompression code (NOT by `ValidateEventBatch`) when zstd/gzip framing fails or `MaxDecompressedBatchBytes` is exceeded. Decompression runs after `ValidateEventBatch` accepts the frame envelope, so a streaming-decode failure is not a "frame-validation" failure in the validator sense - it has no `wtpv1.ValidationReason` constant and exists only on the metrics side. `classifier_bypass` - incremented by the receiver-side `errors.As`-false defense-in-depth guard described below; signals a programming bug where a non-validator caller returned an `ErrInvalidFrame`-related error WITHOUT wrapping it in `*wtpv1.ValidationError`. Also has no proto-side counterpart because by definition the validator never emits it.

   The label key is `reason` to match the existing `wtp_reconnects_total{reason}` convention (and the planned `wtp_session_init_failures_total{reason}` / `wtp_session_rotation_failures_total{reason}` families introduced in Task 22a). The `unknown` reason and the `classifier_bypass` reason are deliberately split so operators can distinguish two very different failure modes without log correlation: `unknown` means schema drift on a peer (validator returned `ReasonUnknown` for a new oneof arm), while `classifier_bypass` means a code-path bug on the local side (an `ErrInvalidFrame`-related error reached the receiver classifier WITHOUT a `*ValidationError` wrapper). A non-zero `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="unknown"}` series MUST be treated as an operator-visible signal that a new validator failure class has shipped without being added to the enum; the next maintenance cycle MUST extend the enum (both `wtpv1.ValidationReason` and `WTPInvalidFrameReason`) to classify it under a dedicated label. A non-zero `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="classifier_bypass"}` series is by contrast a defect indicator - operators MUST find and fix the non-validator code path that bypassed the typed classifier (see the runbook subsection below).

   **Reason classification (validator contract).** `ValidateEventBatch` and `ValidateSessionInit` MUST return `*wtpv1.ValidationError` for every failure path, including the forward-compat unknown-oneof case (which returns `&ValidationError{Reason: ReasonUnknown, Inner: fmt.Errorf("unknown body oneof case")}`). A bare `fmt.Errorf("%w: ...", wtpv1.ErrInvalidFrame, ...)` return from a validator is a CONTRACT VIOLATION - there is no escape hatch from the typed boundary, and the `unknown` reason exists explicitly so the validator never has to fall back to a non-typed return. Receivers consume the reason via `errors.As(err, &ve)` and forward `ve.Reason` directly into `IncDroppedInvalidFrame`. Receivers MUST NOT inspect `err.Error()` or any substring of the formatted message to derive a reason - the typed boundary is the contract; the formatted message embeds peer-supplied byte counts and oneof discriminators that violate the sanitization rule.

   **Receiver-side defense in depth (should never trigger in production).** Receivers SHOULD nonetheless implement an `errors.As`-false guard that classifies a non-`*ValidationError` return as `reason="classifier_bypass"` (NOT `reason="unknown"` - those are now disjoint reasons with disjoint operator interpretations) and emits a WARN-level diagnostic (with `err_type` from `fmt.Sprintf("%T", err)` and `reason="classifier_bypass"`). This guard exists for the case where a non-validator caller passes a bare error into the receiver-side classifier (e.g., a unit-test mock or a future code path that bypasses `ValidateEventBatch`). For validator-returned errors `errors.As` SHOULD always succeed; if a deployed binary ever logs `non-typed frame validation error`, the validator path was bypassed and operators MUST investigate.
3. For client-side frames, send `Goaway{code: GOAWAY_CODE_UNSPECIFIED, message: "frame validation failed: <detail>"}` and close the session. For server-side frames, the client triggers a reconnect with reason `stream_recv_error`.

**Invalid-frame log sanitization.** Frame contents come from untrusted peers, so receivers MUST log only (a) the `reason` enum value and (b) a fixed-length hex prefix (≤16 bytes) of the offending frame's serialized representation. Receivers MUST NOT log the raw protobuf payload, claimed-but-unverified field values from the offending frame, or unbounded peer-supplied strings (e.g., a peer-controlled `message` field, a peer-controlled session ID echoed back, or any other byte slice that the validator has by definition not yet trusted). The same rationale that bans payload bytes from mapper-error strings (see "Mapper error sanitization" below) applies here: the structured log is emitted verbatim and may be ingested into operator-facing pipelines, so the validator must not become a data-exfiltration vector for the peer.

Sanitization applies to ALL log emission paths, not just the structured drop-class record at the receiver. The contract is type-enforced: every validator failure path returns `*wtpv1.ValidationError` (per the "MUST return `*ValidationError`" rule above), whose `Error()` method returns ONLY the canonical reason string. Outer log paths that log the bare error therefore receive only the reason string, not peer-derived content. Transport-layer interceptors (gRPC unary/stream interceptors, panic-recovery handlers, debug-trace formatters) and any other code that touches a `*wtpv1.ValidationError` or its `Inner` error MUST log only the `Reason` field. The `Inner` error MUST NOT be passed to any logger that emits to production sinks because its formatted message embeds the same peer-supplied byte counts and oneof discriminators the structured-log rule excludes; routing it through a different logger does not change the threat model. The `unknown` reason exists explicitly so the validator never has to fall back to a non-typed return - there is no escape hatch.

Implementations MUST make this enforceable at the type level by giving `*ValidationError` an `Error() string` method that returns ONLY the canonical reason value (no peer-derived content) - this means even a naive `slog.Error("...", "err", ve)` or `fmt.Sprintf("%s", ve)` cannot leak peer bytes. Combined with the validator's all-paths-return-`*ValidationError` contract, this means EVERY validator-returned error has a peer-safe `Error()` method by construction. The `Inner` error remains accessible via `Unwrap()` for in-memory inspection during tests (and for `errors.Is` / `errors.As` chain traversal), but is never serialized to logs. The TDD test for `ValidationError.Error()` MUST assert e.g. `(&ValidationError{Reason: ReasonPayloadTooLarge, Inner: fmt.Errorf("32MiB exceeds 8MiB cap")}).Error() == "payload_too_large"` to lock the behavior in.

**Stable production API.** `ValidationReason`, the constant set (`Reason*`), and the `AllValidationReasons() []ValidationReason` getter are STABLE PRODUCTION API - not test-only helpers. Any code that wires validator errors into metrics, alerting, or operator dashboards needs the canonical enumeration. The metrics package consumes `AllValidationReasons()` for its parity test, and external operators may consume it for dashboard generation or alert templating. The getter MUST remain stable across versions: appending a new reason is non-breaking; renaming or removing a reason is a breaking change that requires a coordinated metrics + dashboards migration. The getter returns a fresh copy on each call so callers cannot mutate the underlying enumeration - see the implementation note in the plan (Task 17 Step 4).

**EXCEPTION (carve-out within an unstable-until-1.0 package).** The `canyonroad.wtp.v1` package as a whole is pre-1.0 unstable per the §"Schema stability" section immediately below - tag numbers, field types, and enum values may change between commits, and there are no live deployments to break. The reason classification surface above is explicitly carved out from that pre-1.0 instability: `ValidationReason`, the `Reason*` constants, and `AllValidationReasons()` are STABLE within the otherwise-unstable package. Additions are non-breaking; removals or renames of existing reason constants require a coordinated metrics + dashboards migration and are treated as breaking changes regardless of pre-1.0 status. The rest of the proto package retains its current pre-1.0 instability - only the reason classification surface is locked. This carve-out exists because operators and external dashboard consumers depend on the reason string values being durable: a reason rename silently breaks every dashboard panel keyed on the old label value, and a removal silently drops alert rules. The §"Schema stability" rules below apply to everything else in the package; this paragraph is the sole exception.

**Validator coverage by phase.** Phase 4a-ii ships validators for the two frames the client already constructs and the server-side test fixtures already accept: `EventBatch` (body presence, body/compression agreement, payload cap) and `SessionInit` (algorithm enum). The remaining frame validators - `TransportLoss`, `Goaway`, `Heartbeat`, `ServerHeartbeat`, `BatchAck`, `SessionAck`, `SessionUpdate`, `ClientShutdown` - land alongside the receivers that consume them in **Phase 8** (transport state machine, where the client interprets every inbound `ServerMessage`) and **Phase 9** (in-tree testserver, where the server side validates inbound `ClientMessage`). Until those phases land, schema-valid frames of those types are accepted as-is.

#### Schema stability

The `canyonroad.wtp.v1` package is **unstable until the first tagged 1.0 release of the WTP protocol** (separate from the aep-caw release version), with ONE exception: the reason classification surface (`ValidationReason`, the `Reason*` constants, and `AllValidationReasons()`) is carved out as STABLE within this otherwise-unstable package - see the §"Stable production API" paragraph immediately above for the carve-out details. Pre-1.0 (everything OTHER than the carved-out reason surface):

- Tag numbers, field types, and enum values may change between commits with no migration burden. There are no live deployments to break.
- Generated `.pb.go` is regenerated on every change. Goldens (Phase 4b) are regenerated to match.
- Mixed client/server versions are NOT supported; both sides must be built from the same commit.

Post-1.0, the forward-compatibility rules below take effect:

- Existing tag numbers MUST be preserved. Removed fields are marked `reserved`.
- Wire-incompatible changes (type change, tag reassignment, enum-value reuse) require a fresh package version (`canyonroad.wtp.v2`) and a per-side migration plan.
- The 1.0 cut is gated on (a) at least one external implementation having validated the conformance vectors and (b) the decision being recorded in this spec under `#### Stability cut`.

Forward compatibility (post-1.0):

- Unknown enum values MUST be treated as `*_UNSPECIFIED` and produce the same drop-and-error path. Adding a new enum value is therefore a wire break for older clients/servers; bump `format_version` in the same change.
- New oneof arms in `ClientMessage`/`ServerMessage` are forward-compatible only if the receiver tolerates the unset case as a no-op rather than a protocol error. We declare new arms NON-forward-compatible until per-arm rollout policy is added in a future spec revision.
- New fields with new tags are forward-compatible only if they default to a meaningful zero value. Adding required-meaning fields is a wire break.

### Compression safety

**MVP scope.** The Phase 4a-ii client always emits `Compression_COMPRESSION_NONE`; no compression encode or decode path ships in this implementation cycle. The caps below are documentation contracts that any future decompression code MUST honor. Wire goldens (Phase 4b) cover only the uncompressed body shape.

When `EventBatch.compression` is `COMPRESSION_ZSTD` or `COMPRESSION_GZIP`, receivers MUST enforce two independent caps before decompression:

1. **Compressed-payload cap**: `len(compressed_payload) <= 8 MiB`. Larger payloads are rejected with `Goaway{code: GOAWAY_CODE_UNSPECIFIED, message: "compressed payload exceeds cap"}` and the session closed.
2. **Decompressed-size cap**: streaming decoder configured with a hard limit of `64 MiB` per batch. Exceeding the cap aborts decompression and triggers the same Goaway path. Decoders MUST stream-and-cap, not allocate up-front from a header.

Malformed compressed payloads (zstd/gzip framing errors) are protocol-level errors handled identically to schema-valid-but-semantically-invalid frames per "Frame validation" above. Receivers MUST NOT log or surface decompressed payload bytes when rejecting; only the framing error category is recorded.

The 8 MiB / 64 MiB caps are conservative defaults sized so that a single batch fits in CPU L3 plus some slack on commodity hardware; future revisions may raise them but receivers MUST always apply some cap (no `0 = unlimited` semantic).

### Backoff

Exponential with jitter: `min(base * 2^n, max) ± 30%`. Defaults: base=500ms, max=30s. Reset on successful SessionInit + first ack received.

### Metrics

All exposed via slog at debug + as structured counters consumable by the existing `internal/metrics` registry:

- `wtp_events_appended_total` (counter)
- `wtp_events_acked_total` (counter)
- `wtp_batches_sent_total` (counter)
- `wtp_bytes_sent_total` (counter, post-compression)
- `wtp_transport_loss_total` (counter)
- `wtp_reconnects_total` (counter, labeled by reason; reason is one of: `dial_failed`, `stream_recv_error`, `send_error`, `ack_timeout`, `heartbeat_timeout`, `server_goaway`, `unknown`)
  - `dial_failed`: gRPC `Dial`/`NewClient` failed before any stream opened.
  - `stream_recv_error`: stream `Recv` returned a non-EOF error after a session was established.
  - `send_error`: stream `Send`/`CloseSend` returned an error.
  - `ack_timeout`: no `BatchAck` received within the configured ack-timeout window for in-flight batches.
  - `heartbeat_timeout`: no `ServerHeartbeat` received within the configured heartbeat-timeout window.
  - `server_goaway`: server sent a `Goaway` frame requesting reconnect.
  - `unknown`: catch-all when the reconnect cause cannot be classified.
- `wtp_session_state` (gauge: 0=connecting, 1=replaying, 2=live, 3=shutdown)
- `wtp_wal_segments` (gauge)
- `wtp_wal_bytes` (gauge)
- `wtp_ack_high_watermark` (gauge)
- `wtp_dropped_invalid_mapper_total` (counter; increments when `compact.Encode` returns `ErrInvalidMapper` - defense in depth, normally 0 because `Store.New` rejects the same condition at construction time; non-zero indicates a code path mutated the mapper post-construction; structured log with fields {session_id, sequence, generation, err})
- `wtp_dropped_invalid_timestamp_total` (counter; increments when `compact.Encode` returns `ErrInvalidTimestamp` because `ev.Timestamp` is zero or pre-epoch; structured log with fields {session_id, sequence, generation, err})
- `wtp_dropped_mapper_failure_total` (counter; increments when `compact.Encode` returns a wrapped mapper-side error - i.e., `mapper.Map()` returned a non-sentinel error and `Encode` wrapped it as `compact mapper: %w`; this is the catch-all for mapper-internal failures and falls through the default branch of the `errors.Is` classification switch in `AppendEvent`; structured log with fields {session_id, sequence, generation, err})
- `wtp_dropped_invalid_utf8_total` (counter; increments when `chain.ErrInvalidUTF8` surfaces from the canonical encoder for any record-level encode - record is dropped, structured log emitted with fields {session_id, sequence, generation, err}; the offending field name appears as text inside the wrapped error message - `chain: invalid utf-8 in string field: field "<name>"` - operators grep `err` for diagnostics rather than relying on a separate structured attribute)
- `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason}` (counter labeled by frame-validation reason; increments when a schema-valid but semantically invalid protocol frame is dropped per the "Frame validation and forward compatibility" section above; reasons follow the same fixed-enum + escapeLabelValue pattern as `wtp_session_init_failures_total{reason}`. The reason set splits into two disjoint categories: **validator-emitted reasons** (proto-side `wtpv1.ValidationReason` constants returned by `ValidateEventBatch`/`ValidateSessionInit` as `*wtpv1.ValidationError`) - `event_batch_body_unset`, `event_batch_compression_unspecified`, `session_init_algorithm_unspecified`, `event_batch_compression_mismatch`, `payload_too_large`, and `unknown` - these MUST appear in BOTH the proto-side `ValidationReason` enum and the metrics-side `WTPInvalidFrameReason` enum with byte-equal string values; and **metrics-only reasons** - `decompress_error` (streaming decompression fails or exceeds `MaxDecompressedBatchBytes` - emitted by the streaming-decompression code downstream of `ValidateEventBatch`, with no proto-side counterpart) and `classifier_bypass` (incremented by the receiver-side `errors.As`-false defense-in-depth guard when a non-validator caller passes a bare `ErrInvalidFrame`-related error into the classifier - also no proto-side counterpart by definition because the validator never emits it). The `unknown` reason is RESERVED for the validator-emitted forward-compat unknown-oneof case (validator returns `&ValidationError{Reason: ReasonUnknown, ...}` rather than a bare `fmt.Errorf`); a non-zero `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="unknown"}` series remains operator-visible signal that a new validator failure class has shipped without a dedicated label and the next maintenance cycle MUST extend the enum to cover it. A non-zero `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="classifier_bypass"}` series is by contrast a code-path defect indicator - see the "Operator runbook" subsection below for triage guidance. Structured log emitted with fields {session_id, reason, hex_prefix} where `session_id` is the local session UUID (NOT peer-supplied), `reason` is the canonical enum value (NOT peer-supplied), and `hex_prefix` is a hex-encoded prefix of the offending frame's serialized representation capped at 16 input bytes (so 32 hex chars output) per the "Invalid-frame log sanitization" rule. The raw `err` returned by `wtpv1.ValidateEventBatch` / `ValidateSessionInit` MUST NOT be logged because its formatted message embeds peer-supplied byte counts and oneof discriminators that violate the sanitization rule; if implementers need debug visibility for a specific failure class they SHOULD bump the validator log level locally during diagnosis, not change the production field set. Chain/sequence are NOT logged because frame-validation failures occur before per-record drop bookkeeping. See "Operator runbook: invalid-frame reason interpretation" below for triage guidance per reason.)
- `wtp_session_init_failures_total{reason}` (counter labeled by reason; reason `invalid_utf8` increments when ComputeContextDigest at SessionInit returns ErrInvalidUTF8; structured log with same `err`-string convention)
- `wtp_session_rotation_failures_total{reason}` (counter labeled by reason; reason `invalid_utf8` increments when ComputeContextDigest during SessionUpdate or chain rotation returns ErrInvalidUTF8; structured log with same `err`-string convention)
- `wtp_dropped_sequence_overflow_total` (counter; increments when `ev.Chain.Sequence > math.MaxInt64` at the store-integration boundary - record is dropped before WAL admission, structured log emitted with fields {session_id, sequence, generation})
- `wtp_wal_corruption_total` (counter; CRC corruption events during WAL replay)
- `wtp_send_latency_seconds` (histogram, per batch)

Dashboard/alerting impact. The new sink-failure metrics - five unlabeled counters (`wtp_dropped_invalid_mapper_total`, `wtp_dropped_invalid_timestamp_total`, `wtp_dropped_mapper_failure_total`, `wtp_dropped_invalid_utf8_total`, `wtp_dropped_sequence_overflow_total`) plus three labeled families (`wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason}`, `wtp_session_init_failures_total{reason}`, `wtp_session_rotation_failures_total{reason}`) - all follow the always-emit contract: the families appear at zero on every scrape regardless of activity, so adding them does not change cardinality at quiescence. Rollout phasing is reason-aware (see "Rollout phasing" subsection below) - newly added always-emit metric NAMES are zero-rollout-friendly because no existing dashboard/alert can be keyed on a metric name that did not exist; semantic narrowing of an EXISTING label value or REMOVAL of an existing series is operator-facing and requires monitoring preflight. New alerting rules can be added at operator discretion. Suggested alerting (the labeled `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason}` family is reason-aware - see "Alerting policy (per reason) for `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total`" below; `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total` (without a `reason` label) MUST NOT have a blanket alert, because the appropriate operator action depends on the reason value):
- Page on `rate(wtp_session_init_failures_total[5m]) > 0` - unrecoverable misconfiguration.
- Alert-not-page on `rate(wtp_dropped_invalid_utf8_total[5m]) > 0.01` - event source corruption.
- Alert-not-page on `rate(wtp_dropped_invalid_mapper_total[5m]) > 0` - defense-in-depth tripwire; non-zero means a code-path bug bypassed `Store.New` validation.
- Alert-not-page on `rate(wtp_dropped_invalid_timestamp_total[5m]) > 0` - producers emitting zero or pre-epoch timestamps; usually benign but indicates upstream stamping is missing.
- Alert-not-page on `rate(wtp_dropped_mapper_failure_total[5m]) > 0.01` - mapper implementation returning errors; investigate the wrapped `err` in the structured log.

#### Alerting policy (per reason) for `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total`

`wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason}` MUST be alerted per-reason - a single blanket rule against `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total` (without the `reason` label) would conflate operationally distinct failure modes and produce the wrong page/alert decision. The runbook below ("Operator runbook: invalid-frame reason interpretation") is the source of truth for how to triage each reason; the policy summary here MUST stay aligned with it.

- **`unknown`**: ALERT (do not page) on `rate(wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="unknown"}[5m]) > 0` sustained over 5 min. Triage during business hours. Action: a peer rolled out a new schema and the local validator does not recognize the new `body` oneof discriminator; extend `ValidationReason` (and its metrics-side mirror `WTPInvalidFrameReason`) to cover the new case.
- **`classifier_bypass`**: PAGE on the first non-zero observation (`increase(wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="classifier_bypass"}[5m]) > 0`). This counter is a local-bug indicator - the validator contract was violated. Action: identify and fix the offending caller immediately (search recent WARN logs for either `err_type` (receiver-side path) or `raw_reason` (metrics-side label-collapse path) - see runbook below).
- **`decompress_error`**: ALERT (do not page) on `rate(wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="decompress_error"}[5m]) > 1/min` sustained over 5 min. Triage during business hours. Action: peer-side compression bug or misconfigured payload cap (`MaxDecompressedBatchBytes`); inspect peer logs for the encoder version and configured caps.
- **`event_batch_body_unset`, `event_batch_compression_unspecified`, `event_batch_compression_mismatch`, `session_init_algorithm_unspecified`, `payload_too_large`** (validator-emitted, peer-side schema-valid-but-semantically-broken frames): ALERT (do not page) on `rate(wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="<value>"}[5m]) > 1/min` sustained over 5 min. Triage during business hours. Action: peer-side bug; cross-reference the peer's `agent_version` (from `SessionInit`) and notify the peer team to align their frame construction with the spec.

The aggregate-rate metric `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total` (without a `reason` label) MUST NOT have a blanket alert - alerting is reason-aware per the matrix above. Operators with prior dashboards keyed on the unlabeled aggregate MUST migrate to per-reason rules; see "Migration from pre-split `unknown`" below for the migration recipe (the same caveat applies in the opposite direction: a single rule against the family-without-label collapses the runbook's action mapping into one alert text).

#### Operator runbook: invalid-frame reason interpretation

The `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason}` family carries three operator-actionable reason values whose semantics differ enough that a single alert text cannot describe the right response. The runbook below maps each reason value to the underlying failure mode, the operator action, and a per-reason alert threshold. (The remaining validator-emitted reasons - `event_batch_body_unset`, `event_batch_compression_unspecified`, `event_batch_compression_mismatch`, `session_init_algorithm_unspecified`, `payload_too_large` - share the same generic interpretation: a peer is sending a schema-valid but semantically broken frame, identified by the reason label; the action is to inspect peer logs for the offending frame and align the peer with the spec. The three reasons below are called out separately because their interpretation is non-obvious or actionable in a non-generic way.)

- **`unknown`** - Validator returned `ReasonUnknown`. This means a peer has sent an `EventBatch` with a `body` oneof discriminator that the local validator does not recognize - typically a schema drift where the peer is on a newer protobuf version than the local binary. Action: cross-reference the peer's `agent_version` (from `SessionInit`), check the proto schema at that version, and add the missing case to `ValidateEventBatch` (which entails extending `ValidationReason` with a new dedicated constant and mirroring it into the metrics-side `WTPInvalidFrameReason` enum - see §"Stable production API"). While unaddressed, peers using the new discriminator will be rejected and disconnected. Alert threshold: any non-zero rate sustained over 5 min indicates a peer rolled out a new schema and the receiver needs an update.
- **`classifier_bypass`** - Local-side defect indicator. Two code paths feed this reason and BOTH emit a WARN-level structured log when triggered (operators MUST grep recent WARN logs to determine which path fired):
  - **Receiver path** (defense-in-depth `errors.As`-false guard): a code path returned an `ErrInvalidFrame`-related error WITHOUT wrapping it in `*wtpv1.ValidationError`. Log line: `slog.Warn("non-typed frame validation error", "err_type", fmt.Sprintf("%T", err), "reason", "classifier_bypass")` - grep recent WARN logs for `non-typed frame validation error` and inspect `err_type` to identify the offending caller's error type.
  - **Metrics path** (`IncDroppedInvalidFrame` invalid-label collapse): a caller passed a `WTPInvalidFrameReason` value that is not in the canonical `wtpInvalidFrameReasonsValid` set. Log line: `slog.Warn("invalid invalid-frame reason label", "raw_reason", reason, "reason", "classifier_bypass")` where `raw_reason` is the unknown string the caller passed (this string is internal - caller-controlled, NEVER peer-derived - so it is safe to log verbatim per the invalid-frame log sanitization rule). Grep recent WARN logs for `invalid invalid-frame reason label` and inspect `raw_reason` to identify the offending callsite.

  Both paths are programming bugs - the validator contract requires every failure to be a typed `*ValidationError`, and metrics callers MUST use the canonical `WTPInvalidFrameReason*` constants. Action: search for non-`*ValidationError` returns of `ErrInvalidFrame` in the codebase (`rg -n "fmt.Errorf.*ErrInvalidFrame" proto/ internal/`) AND for any `IncDroppedInvalidFrame` callers that construct a `WTPInvalidFrameReason` from a string literal or peer-supplied value rather than a constant. Use the WARN log discriminator above to narrow the search to the path that actually fired. Alert threshold: ANY non-zero increment is a bug - this counter should be permanently zero in healthy production. Page (do not just alert-not-page) on the first non-zero observation; the longer the bug runs unfixed, the more drift accumulates between the typed boundary contract and actual code.

  **WARN rate-limit (both `classifier_bypass` paths).** Both `classifier_bypass` WARN log paths (the receiver-side `non-typed frame validation error` and the metrics-side `invalid invalid-frame reason label`) MUST be rate-limited to AT MOST 10 emissions per minute per process. Without rate-limiting, a hot-path bug (e.g., a tight loop calling `IncDroppedInvalidFrame` with a bad string, or a receive-loop returning a bare `ErrInvalidFrame`-related error on every frame) would turn a runtime defect into a log-storage incident. Implementation: a SHARED package-level token bucket (e.g., `golang.org/x/time/rate.NewLimiter(rate.Every(6*time.Second), 1)`) lives in the metrics package and is consumed by BOTH code-paths so a single bursty caller does not starve the other path's diagnostic; the limiter starts full so the first emission per process burst is always allowed. The COUNTER (`wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="classifier_bypass"}`) tracks the true volume regardless of throttling - operators read the metric for the rate signal and the (sampled) WARN log for the diagnostic discriminator (`err_type` for receiver path, `raw_reason` for metrics path).

  When the rate-limiter throttles a WARN, the suppressed event is NOT counted by any auxiliary "logs dropped" metric - operators reading the throttled WARN see the actual error type and the corresponding counter rate gives them the volume signal. The first emission per process burst is always allowed (token bucket starts full). The rate-limit applies ONLY to `classifier_bypass` WARN paths; other validator-emitted-reason WARN logs (the receiver path that emits per-frame logs for legitimate validator failures) follow the existing per-frame logging contract - those are already gated by the receiver tearing down the stream and entering reconnect/Goaway, so log volume is bounded by the peer disconnecting.

- **`decompress_error`** - Streaming decompression failed (corrupt zstd/gzip stream, exceeded `MaxDecompressedBatchBytes`). Action: peer is sending malformed or oversized payloads. Check peer logs for compression configuration (encoder version, payload caps configured). Alert threshold: sustained non-zero rate indicates a peer-side compression bug or a misconfigured payload cap; one-off spikes during normal operation are expected at low rates due to network corruption.

#### Migration from pre-split `unknown`

Prior versions of this spec used a single `reason="unknown"` value to cover both validator schema drift and defense-in-depth bypass. The split into `unknown` (validator-emitted, schema drift) and `classifier_bypass` (metrics-only, local-side bug) means any existing queries, dashboards, or alerts keyed on `reason="unknown"` will under-count after the split - they will silently miss the `classifier_bypass` cases (and a `classifier_bypass`-keyed query will silently miss the schema-drift cases). Operators MUST audit their alert/dashboard definitions before rollout and update each `reason="unknown"` reference to one of the following, depending on the original intent:

- `reason="unknown"` (unchanged label string, narrowed semantics) - keep this if the intent was to detect schema drift only. Recommended for capacity-planning panels where the operationally interesting signal is "the peer rolled out a newer protobuf schema than the local binary supports".
- `reason=~"unknown|classifier_bypass"` - use this if the intent was to detect ALL un-classified frame failures (the pre-split semantic). Recommended for legacy dashboards being migrated incrementally; pair with a follow-up split into the two reason-specific panels per the alerting policy above so the page/alert decision can diverge.
- `reason="classifier_bypass"` - use this if the intent was specifically to alert on local code-path bypass. This SHOULD be a high-severity page per the "Alerting policy (per reason)" subsection above; in healthy production this counter is permanently zero.

The pre-split `unknown` series is NOT preserved; there is no shim, alias, or zero-emit deprecation window for the old combined semantic. This is a breaking change for any panels/alerts that depend on a single `unknown` value covering both meanings - the rollout will silently change the semantics of existing `reason="unknown"` queries unless the operator audits and updates them. Cross-reference: the runbook entries for `unknown` and `classifier_bypass` above are the source of truth for the post-split semantics.

Migration guidance: removed `wtp_dropped_missing_chain_total`. The earlier Task 3 metric inventory shipped a `wtp_dropped_missing_chain_total` counter that tracked missing-chain as a silent drop. The semantics changed in Round 4: missing-chain is now propagated from `AppendEvent` as a wrapped `compact.ErrMissingChain` error rather than silently dropped, so the underlying event class the counter tracked no longer exists and the counter is removed (Task 22a Step 3.5 in the implementation plan). Operators should plan accordingly:

- Operators currently scraping `wtp_dropped_missing_chain_total` will see the series disappear from `/metrics` after the rollout. There is no zero-emit deprecation window - the field, accessor, and emit lines are all deleted in the same change.
- The closest replacements depend on what operators were using the old counter for:
  - If the dashboard/alert was watching for composite-store regressions, the **only guaranteed emission signal** is the ERROR-severity structured log emitted by `AppendEvent` per §"Caller contract for propagated `compact.ErrMissingChain`" - there is NO guaranteed metric-side surface, because per that contract clause (b) the sink MUST NOT auto-disable or self-shutdown and clause (c) the caller MAY log-and-continue without tearing the WTP stream down. Operators MUST therefore replace the metric-based alert with one of:
    - **Log-based alert/SLO** (recommended). Alert on the ERROR-severity structured log entry whose `err` field equals the exact sentinel string `"compact.Encode: ev.Chain is nil; composite did not stamp"` (the value of `compact.ErrMissingChain.Error()` - see `internal/store/watchtower/compact/encoder.go`'s `ErrMissingChain` definition). The trigger contract is the `err` sentinel match plus a component-source-scoping clause when required by the field-preservation classification (see below). The full field set emitted by `AppendEvent` is `{event_id, session_id, event_type, err}` per §"Caller contract for propagated `compact.ErrMissingChain`" clause (a), but the auxiliary fields (`event_id`, `session_id`, `event_type`) play a DIAGNOSTIC role only - they give the on-call engineer per-event context after the alert fires; they are not part of the alert-trigger predicate. Whether the alert query may also bind `event_type` / `session_id` / `event_id` as predicates depends on the field-preservation classification below: under `ok`, all four are queryable; under `err-only`, only `err` plus the source-scoping clause are guaranteed-queryable; under `msg-only`, only the rendered message body plus the source-scoping clause are. The `err` string is part of the operator-facing contract - it MUST NOT be silently rewritten without a coordinated monitoring migration, and any future change requires a paired update to this section. Pair the alert with the runbook section that covers missing-chain composite-store regressions; pin the runbook URL in the log-alert/SLO artifact's annotation/description field equivalent (see Task 27a Step 4 for the per-stack mapping). Implementations of the operator monitoring stack (Loki, Splunk, Elastic, Datadog Logs, etc.) all support field-matched alerts on structured log entries; the exact query syntax is operator-stack-specific and not prescribed here. **Field-preservation precondition.** Operators MUST first verify how their production log pipeline preserves the structured field set for this component. Four classifications are supported, of which the first three enable this option:
        - **`field_preservation: ok`.** All four fields (`event_id`, `session_id`, `event_type`, `err`) reach the log-aggregation system as separately queryable / indexed structured fields, AND the `err` value is the exact sentinel string byte-for-byte. The log-based alert MAY use a field-equality predicate on `err` plus the appropriate component scoping (service/logger/source identifier), and MAY additionally bind `event_type` / `session_id` / `event_id` either as alert-trigger predicates or as diagnostic-context labels in the alert payload.
        - **`field_preservation: err-only` (degraded - diagnostic loss only).** The `err` field reaches the log-aggregation system as a separately queryable / indexed structured field with the exact sentinel string byte-for-byte, but one or more of `event_id` / `session_id` / `event_type` is renamed, dropped, or moved into the rendered message body. The alert-trigger surface is unchanged: a structured `err == sentinel` predicate (plus required component source scoping; see msg-only below for why source scoping is mandatory) remains valid AND precise, with no false-positive risk. The cost is purely diagnostic: when the alert fires, operators have less per-event context for triage. Operators choosing this mode MUST record (a) which auxiliary fields are missing, (b) any alternative source the operator can correlate against (e.g. session ID present in the rendered message body, request-trace ID injected by surrounding middleware), and (c) the source-scoping selector - all in the migration tracking artifact, so the on-call runbook can document the diminished context up-front.
        - **`field_preservation: msg-only` (degraded - alert via rendered string).** Neither the structured `err` field NOR a structured replacement is preserved, but the rendered message body still contains the exact sentinel substring byte-for-byte. The log-based alert MAY use a substring/regex predicate against the rendered message body, BUT the predicate MUST also constrain the component source - at minimum a service/logger/source-name match for this binary (e.g. matching the slog logger name for the WTP sink, the OTEL service name, the container/pod label, or the per-stack equivalent). Without source scoping, an unrelated component that happens to log the same sentinel substring will trigger false positives. Operators choosing this degraded mode MUST record the specific scoping selector in the migration tracking artifact alongside the substring predicate.
        - **`field_preservation: broken`.** Neither the structured `err` field NOR the rendered sentinel substring survives end-to-end. This option is NOT available - operators MUST fall back to the **Delete** or **Reconnect-based alert (CONDITIONAL)** options below, OR upgrade their log pipeline before retrying the verification.
        See Task 27a Step 1b in the implementation plan for the canonical verification recipe.
    - **Delete the alert**. Appropriate when the original alert was a coarse catch-all and the team's incident response is keyed on developer-facing diagnostics (the propagated wrapped error in the audit pipeline) rather than per-event monitoring.
    - **Reconnect-based alert (CONDITIONAL - verification required)**. `wtp_reconnects_total{reason="..."}` is a candidate ONLY at sites where the caller wiring DOES tear down the WTP stream on propagated `compact.ErrMissingChain` - the caller contract permits but does NOT require this behavior, so the reconnect family has no contractually guaranteed emission path from this error. Operators choosing this path MUST first verify the caller behavior in their build (inspect the integration code that consumes `AppendEvent`'s returned error, confirm it closes/cancels the WTP stream on `errors.Is(err, compact.ErrMissingChain)`, and record the specific `wtp_reconnects_total{reason}` label the caller emits) AND record the verification reference in the migration tracking artifact alongside the new selector. Without that verification the alert may quietly never fire. The handshake-time families `wtp_session_init_failures_total{reason}` / `wtp_session_rotation_failures_total{reason}` (planned in Task 22a, Phase 8) are NEVER valid redirect targets - those families fire only during the SessionInit/SessionUpdate handshake for context-digest handshake failures (`invalid_utf8` plus the `unknown` catch-all), and there is no defined emission path from a propagated `compact.ErrMissingChain` into them. If a future caller-side wiring change introduces such a path, the design must be extended to declare the new reason label and the source-of-truth contract for it.
  - If the dashboard/alert was watching for protocol-layer drops more broadly, `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="..."}` is the correct replacement family (peer-side semantically-invalid frames). This family is unrelated to `compact.ErrMissingChain` (which is a sink-internal composite-store regression, not a protocol frame failure) and is mentioned here only because operators sometimes co-locate protocol-drop monitoring with composite-regression monitoring on a single panel.
- Recommended operator action as part of the rollout: delete or update any dashboard panel or alerting rule that references `wtp_dropped_missing_chain_total`. The all-zero series can no longer fire by definition; leaving the panel in place produces a misleading "healthy" indicator for a class of failure that is now reported through a different channel.

The rest of the always-emit / zero-init contract for the eight new counters (above) is unchanged - they appear at zero on every scrape from the moment metrics is initialized, regardless of WTP enable state.

#### Rollout phasing

The metrics changes in this design are not uniformly safe to ship without operator coordination. Categorize each change before deciding whether monitoring artifacts must be updated first:

- **No phased rollout required for**: newly added always-emit metric families with new metric NAMES (`wtp_dropped_invalid_mapper_total`, `wtp_dropped_invalid_timestamp_total`, `wtp_dropped_mapper_failure_total`, `wtp_dropped_invalid_utf8_total`, `wtp_dropped_sequence_overflow_total`, `wtp_session_init_failures_total{reason}`, `wtp_session_rotation_failures_total{reason}`, plus newly-named labels added to existing metric names where no operator dashboard/alert is keyed on the new label value). These are zero-rollout-friendly because no existing dashboard or alert can be keyed on a metric name or label value that did not exist before the rollout - they start at zero from the moment code rolls out and acquire operator queries only when operators choose to add them.
- **Phased rollout (or coordinated rollout) REQUIRED for**:
  - `wtp_dropped_invalid_frame_total{reason="unknown"}` semantic narrowing - existing dashboards and alerts keyed on `reason="unknown"` will under-count after rollout because the `classifier_bypass` portion moves out of the `unknown` bucket into a dedicated label value. The label string is unchanged; what changed is what it means. **Monitoring updates MUST ship BEFORE OR WITH the code rollout** - see the "Migration from pre-split `unknown`" subsection above for the per-intent migration recipe.
  - `wtp_dropped_missing_chain_total` removal - the entire series disappears from `/metrics` after rollout. Any dashboard panel or alert rule that references this series will break (no data, or a "no series" error depending on the platform). **Monitoring updates MUST ship BEFORE OR WITH the code rollout** - see the "Migration guidance: removed `wtp_dropped_missing_chain_total`" paragraph above for the redirection map (which existing replacement to use depends on the original intent of the panel).

**Rollout precondition.** All operator-facing monitoring artifacts - Prometheus alerting rules, Grafana panels, runbook URLs in alert annotations - MUST be updated to reference the new reason taxonomy AND to remove or redirect `wtp_dropped_missing_chain_total` references, BEFORE the code rollout reaches production. Ownership split:

- **Implementation team owns** the preflight check that this update has happened in the production monitoring environment.
- **SRE/ops team owns** the actual monitoring artifact updates (Prometheus alerting rules, Grafana panels, runbook URLs).

Both responsibilities MUST be acknowledged with explicit sign-off (a written confirmation in the rollout ticket, or equivalent) before the production code rollout begins. The implementation team SHALL NOT begin the production rollout until SRE/ops has confirmed the migration is complete in production monitoring. Cross-reference: the migration paragraphs above ("Migration from pre-split `unknown`" and "Migration guidance: removed `wtp_dropped_missing_chain_total`") are the source of truth for the artifact-level changes; the corresponding implementation-plan task ("Operator monitoring migration") sequences the work and gates the production-rollout step.

Composite-store regression note. The `compact.Encode` `ErrMissingChain` branch is intentionally NOT a counter. Missing-chain is a programming error - the composite store MUST stamp `ev.Chain` before fanning out to any sink, and a sink reaching `Encode` with a nil chain indicates a composite-store regression that operators should surface loudly. `AppendEvent` therefore propagates `ErrMissingChain` to the caller as a wrapped error (`watchtower: %w`) rather than dropping silently. See the Encode boundary semantics paragraph below for the contrast with the silent-drop classes.

Backwards-compat operator note. Operators enabling WTP after deployment should monitor `wtp_dropped_invalid_timestamp_total` for the first window. Existing producers that previously emitted `types.Event{}` zero-valued (e.g., test-derived paths) will hit `ErrInvalidTimestamp` and be dropped at the WTP boundary. Recommended remediation: stamp `ev.Timestamp = time.Now()` at the producer. The drop is silent (sink-internal - `AppendEvent` returns `nil`, never propagating to the caller), so only the metric and structured WARN log surface it.

Producers with legitimate historical timestamps (e.g., importing audit logs from external systems) MUST clamp or reject pre-epoch values upstream. WTP rejects pre-epoch timestamps unconditionally because the wire format is `uint64` nanoseconds - there is no representation for pre-1970 instants. This is an explicit limitation of the protocol; if pre-epoch ingestion is required, the producer must either offset to a post-epoch value (preserving relative ordering) or use a separate audit pipeline.

Histogram exposition snapshots bucket counts under the latency mutex and writes them unlocked, so a slow scrape never blocks `ObserveSendLatency` callers on the hot send path.

WTP metric series are always emitted, even when the sink is disabled. Zero-valued counters and gauges keep dashboards stable across config changes; presence of the family is not a signal that WTP is enabled (use `wtp_session_state` to detect a live session).

## Configuration & Wiring

### Config struct

Mirrors spec §10.2 verbatim. Loaded by the existing `internal/config` package alongside other sink configs.

```go
type Config struct {
    Enabled bool

    Endpoint   string            // host:port
    SessionID  string            // optional; auto-generated ULID if empty
    StateDir   string            // default: per-OS state dir + "/wtp" (Linux: $XDG_STATE_HOME/aep-caw/wtp; macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/aep-caw/wtp; Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\aep-caw\wtp - non-roaming, distinct from APPDATA)
    EphemeralMode bool

    TLS struct {
        InsecureSkipVerify bool   // tests/dev only
        CACertFile         string
        ClientCertFile     string
        ClientKeyFile      string
    }

    Auth struct {
        TokenFile      string    // mutually exclusive with the others
        TokenEnv       string
        ClientCertAuth bool      // use mTLS cert as identity; no bearer
    }

    Chain struct {
        Algorithm string  // hmac-sha256 | hmac-sha512 (default sha256)
        KeyFile   string  // resolved via existing internal/audit/kms LoadKey
        KeyEnv    string
        // KMS sources (AWS, Azure, Vault, GCP) reuse internal/audit/kms
        // config blocks; we share that struct rather than re-declare it.
        // Each sink may use a different key (per Phase 0 contract); only the
        // shared (sequence, generation) is required to match across sinks.
    }

    Batch struct {
        MaxEvents       int           // default 256; ephemeral 64
        MaxBytes        int           // default 256 KiB; ephemeral 64 KiB
        MaxTimespan     time.Duration // default 5s; ephemeral 1s
        FlushInterval   time.Duration // default 1s; ephemeral 200ms
        Compression     string        // "zstd" (default) | "gzip" | "none"
        ZstdLevel       int           // default 3
    }

    WAL struct {
        SegmentSize    int64         // default 16 MiB; ephemeral 4 MiB
        MaxTotalBytes  int64         // default 1 GiB; ephemeral 64 MiB
        SyncMode       string        // "immediate" (default) | "deferred"
        SyncInterval   time.Duration // for deferred; default 100ms
    }

    Heartbeat struct {
        Interval        time.Duration // default 30s; ephemeral 10s
        ReconnectAfterMisses int      // default 2
    }

    Backoff struct {
        Base time.Duration // default 500ms
        Max  time.Duration // default 30s
    }

    Filter wtpfilter.Filter   // see "Filter generalization" below - currently
                              // OTEL has its own private filter type; we
                              // generalize it into a shared package as part
                              // of this work.
}
```

### applyDefaults() and validate()

`applyDefaults()` checks `EphemeralMode` and overrides any zero-valued fields with the ephemeral profile *before* falling back to the standard defaults. `validate()` enforces:

- Exactly one of `Auth.TokenFile`, `Auth.TokenEnv`, `Auth.ClientCertAuth` is set (strict mutual exclusion; configuration ambiguity is a fail-closed error).
- `Endpoint` parses as `host:port`.
- TLS files exist and are readable (early failure beats first-batch failure).
- `StateDir` is writeable.
- `Batch.MaxBytes >= 4 KiB` (avoid pathological tiny batches).
- `WAL.SegmentSize <= WAL.MaxTotalBytes / 2` (need room for at least 2 segments).
- `len(HMACSecret) >= audit.MinKeyLength` (currently 32 bytes for HMAC-SHA256). Mirrors the audit package's precondition so a short key is rejected at watchtower-load time with a watchtower-shaped error rather than surfacing as a generic `audit.NewSinkChain` error mid-construction.

**Watchtower validation vs audit as source of truth.** Watchtower's `Options.validate()` mirrors the audit package's preconditions (currently `MinKeyLength` and the HMAC algorithm whitelist `hmac-sha256` / `hmac-sha512`) so that misconfiguration is caught at watchtower-load time with watchtower-shaped errors, rather than surfacing as a generic audit error mid-construction. If audit's preconditions tighten in the future, watchtower's `validate()` must be updated to match - `audit` remains the canonical source of truth for chain invariants.

### Constructor

```go
func New(ctx context.Context, cfg Config, opts ...Option) (*Store, error)

type Option func(*options)

func WithMapper(m compact.Mapper) Option        // injected from Phase 1
func WithDialer(d transport.Dialer) Option      // injected by AEP-NOSHIP/tests
func WithMetrics(c *metrics.Collector) Option   // injected by host (internal/metrics.Collector)
func WithLogger(l *slog.Logger) Option          // injected by host
func WithChainKey(key []byte, fp string) Option // injected by composite (Phase 0)
```

The host (the aep-caw daemon) is responsible for building the `Store` with the right options. In tests we construct an in-process `testserver.Server` and pass `WithDialer(srv.DialerFor())`, skipping TLS entirely.

**Constructor lifecycle - chain init is a precheck.** `New` constructs the `audit.SinkChain` (via `audit.NewSinkChain`) **before** opening the WAL. Chain construction is pure (no IO side effects), so a failure here returns immediately without leaving a WAL file open or a lock file held. This ordering is mandatory: opening the WAL first and then failing chain construction would leak WAL state on the way out. If a future change reorders so the WAL opens first, that branch MUST `Close()` the WAL on chain-init failure before returning the error.

### Wiring into existing composite

`internal/store/composite/composite.go` already has a `New(primary, output, others...)` constructor. The WTP store is added as another `EventStore` in `others`. The Phase 0 refactor adds a `audit.SequenceAllocator` to composite and stamps `ev.Chain` before fanout (separate doc); this client consumes `ev.Chain` directly.

### Test-only seam: `Options.SinkChainOverrideForTests`

The `watchtower` package exposes `SinkChainOverrideForTests` on its `Options` struct so AppendEvent's drop-path tests can substitute a `chain.SinkChainAPI` double that returns `chain.ErrInvalidUTF8` on every Compute. This is a **permanent** test seam, not transient scaffolding: removing it would either eliminate the failing-sink test (a regression in test coverage) or force the test to construct a parallel `*audit.SinkChain` with a hidden hook (more brittle, more code to maintain). The field type is the watchtower-local `chain.SinkChainAPI` interface - production code wires `audit.NewSinkChain(...)` and wraps the result with `chain.NewWatchtowerSink(...)` (the local adapter described below), and tests substitute any value that satisfies the interface.

**Production-validation enforcement.** `Options.validate()` rejects a non-nil `SinkChainOverrideForTests` outside test mode (gated by an `AllowSinkChainOverrideForTests bool` companion flag, mirroring the existing `AllowStubMapper` pattern). A test that wants the override sets both fields; production callers leave both at the zero value. This makes accidental misuse a startup-time error, not a silent behavior change. See Task 22's `validate()` for the exact rejection.

**API stability.** `Options.SinkChainOverrideForTests` (and its `AllowSinkChainOverrideForTests` companion) are explicitly **exempt** from normal API-stability expectations: they are test-only seams that may be renamed, refactored, or replaced without notice. The `validate()` rejection above prevents production callers from depending on them in the first place.

### Watchtower-local adapter: `chain.WatchtowerSink`

The `internal/store/watchtower/chain` package adds a thin adapter, `chain.WatchtowerSink`, that wraps `*audit.SinkChain` and satisfies `chain.SinkChainAPI`. The constructor is `chain.NewWatchtowerSink(inner *audit.SinkChain) *WatchtowerSink`. The adapter delegates `Compute` and `Commit` directly to the inner chain (the audit phase-0 contract is untouched) and adds one new accessor:

- `PeekPrevHash() string` - implemented as `state := inner.State(); return state.PrevHash` over `audit.SinkChainState`. This is a read-only test seam used in `append_test.go` to assert "chain prev_hash did not advance" after a drop. It does **not** belong on `audit.SinkChain` itself: the audit package's `State()` already returns the full `SinkChainState{Generation, PrevHash, Fatal}` triple, which is sufficient for production callers (composite, snapshot/restore). `PeekPrevHash` is a watchtower test-ergonomics convenience - narrowing `State()` down to the single field the drop tests need - implemented in the adapter. **This is the only added surface area** the watchtower introduces over `audit.SinkChain`; the `Compute`/`Commit` methods are pure pass-through.

### Prerequisite plumbing (in-scope for this work)

These three pieces of plumbing don't exist in the codebase today and must land alongside the WTP sink. Each is small but explicit so reviewers know it's not assumed:

1. **Filter generalization.** `internal/store/otel/otel.go` has a private `Filter` type. We move it into a shared package `internal/store/eventfilter/` (or similar; final name in the implementation plan), update OTEL to consume the shared type, and use it from WTP. Backwards-compatible YAML; no behavior change for OTEL.
2. **YAML config schema.** Add `WatchtowerConfig` under `internal/config/config.go` mirroring §6 above. Wire into the existing `AuditConfig` (or its peer) so the daemon constructs a WTP `Store` when `enabled: true`. Add `config_test.go` cases for default expansion (ephemeral overrides, mutual-exclusion validation).
3. **Metrics wiring.** `internal/metrics.Collector` exposes a counter/gauge registry. Add the `wtp_*` series listed under "Metrics" above as fields on a `metrics.Collector` extension or a sibling collector. The host (the daemon `cmd/aep-caw`) registers them at startup and passes the collector via `WithMetrics`.

None of these three blocks the WTP package's own unit tests - they only matter at host-wiring time. Each shows up as a discrete milestone in §"Implementation Phases" below.

## Testing Strategy

### Five-layer pyramid

| Layer | What | Tooling | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit (pure) | `chain/canonical.go`, `chain/context.go`, `compact/encoder.go`, `transport/batcher.go`, `wal/framing.go` CRC paths | Go test + golden files | `TestCanonicalEncoder_Goldens` |
| Unit (I/O) | `wal.WAL` lifecycle on a real FS (tempdir) | Go test + `t.TempDir()` | `TestWAL_RolloverAndReplay` |
| Unit (state machine) | `transport.state` transitions | Mock `Conn` + table tests | `TestState_GoawayTriggersReconnect` |
| Component | Whole `Store` against `testserver` | bufconn | `TestStore_DropsMidBatchTriggersReplay` |
| Integration | Long-running flow: append, kill server, restart, expect ack catch-up | bufconn with restartable scenario | `TestStore_ServerRestart_AcksCatchUp` |

### High-risk integrity tests (first-class, gated before component layer)

These four cases are explicit milestones - they cover the failure modes most likely to corrupt the audit chain or leak metadata, and they must pass before the component-layer tests run.

| Test | Asserts | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| `TestStore_WALCleanFailure_NoChainAdvance` | A clean `wal.Append` failure (e.g., overflow detected pre-I/O) returns the error to the caller AND `audit.SinkChain.State().PrevHash` is unchanged. The next successful append uses the same `prev_hash` as before the failure. | `internal/store/watchtower/store_failure_test.go` |
| `TestStore_WALAmbiguousFailure_LatchesFatal` | An ambiguous `wal.Append` failure (injected via a fake file with a flaky `Write`) calls `audit.SinkChain.Fatal`. Subsequent `AppendEvent` calls return `audit.ErrFatalIntegrity` without writing to the WAL. The composite `onAppendError` hook receives a `FatalIntegrityError`. | `internal/store/watchtower/store_failure_test.go` |
| `TestEvent_ChainFieldNotMarshaled` | After composite stamps `ev.Chain`, marshaling `ev` to JSON via the JSONL store, the OTEL converter, and `encoding/json.Marshal` directly, the output contains no `chain`, `Chain`, `_integrity_*`, or `sequence` keys at the top level.

### `AppendEvent` context semantics

`AppendEvent` does NOT honor `ctx.Done()` for the WAL write step. The audit-durability invariant is that any event the caller passed to `AppendEvent` either lands in the WAL or returns an error - a partially-cancelled write would corrupt this invariant. Specifically:

- `compact.Encode`, `chain.EncodeCanonical`, `audit.SinkChain.Compute`: pure CPU, no ctx check.
- `wal.Append`: ignores ctx cancellation. The WAL write completes (or fails cleanly/ambiguously) before `AppendEvent` returns.
- `transport.Notify()`: non-blocking channel send; no ctx involvement.

The transport goroutine's outbound gRPC sends DO honor ctx cancellation - they're invisible to the `AppendEvent` caller and respect the connection's context for clean shutdown.

This is documented in the package doc-comment on `Store.AppendEvent` so callers don't expect cancellation semantics.

### `QueryEvents`

WTP is a fire-and-forget transport sink. `QueryEvents` returns `(nil, ErrNotSupported)` matching the pattern in `internal/store/otel/otel.go:138` (`"otel store does not support queries"`). The composite store routes queries to its `primary` (SQLite) and never to `others`, so this never fires in practice.

### `testserver` capabilities

```go
ts := testserver.New(testserver.Options{
    AckDelay:             500 * time.Millisecond,
    DropAfterBatchN:      3,    // per stream; resets on reconnect
    GoawayAfterBatchN:    5,    // per stream; same reset semantics
    SessionAckSeq:        100,  // literal value on SessionAck; zero = zero
    SessionAckGeneration: 0,
    // RejectSession + RejectReason drive the terminal-StateShutdown path.
})
defer ts.Close()

dialer := ts.DialerFor()
store, _ := watchtower.New(ctx, cfg, watchtower.WithDialer(dialer))

// drive the store
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ { store.AppendEvent(ctx, ev) }

// assertions - note: WaitForFirstBatch returns the FIRST batch ever
// recorded on the server, not "the next batch after this call." For
// multi-phase tests, snapshot len(ts.Batches()) before each phase
// and poll until it grows instead.
if _, err := ts.WaitForFirstBatch(5 * time.Second); err != nil { t.Fatal(err) }
if err := ts.AssertSequenceRange(1, 10); err != nil { t.Fatal(err) }
if err := ts.AssertReplayObserved(1, 10); err != nil { t.Fatal(err) }
```

The testserver also exposes a `Batches()` accessor returning deep-copied snapshots of all EventBatches it has received in order, so tests can assert against the full conversation, not just final state.

**Non-goal: protocol validation of malformed CLIENT frames.** The
testserver intentionally records and processes malformed batches
(e.g. `ClientMessage_EventBatch{EventBatch: nil}`, EventBatch with
unset Body oneof) - they are appended to `Batches()` and increment
per-stream `DropAfterBatchN`/`GoawayAfterBatchN` counters. A nil
`*EventBatch` is normalized to a non-nil empty `EventBatch{}` before
storage so accessor paths (`Batches()`, `WaitForFirstBatch()`) never
return a literal nil entry. On the ack path:

  - Default (no fault injection): the server sends `BatchAck(0, 0)`
    after recording the batch.
  - Fault injection: if recording the batch trips
    `DropAfterBatchN`, the stream returns an error BEFORE any ack
    is sent. If it trips `GoawayAfterBatchN`, the server sends a
    `Goaway` frame instead of `BatchAck`. Tests blocking on a
    BatchAck under those scenarios will time out - that is the
    intended fault behavior, not a harness bug.

The proto contract (§7.3) says receivers MUST reject unset-body
batches; this harness deliberately deviates so that the assertion
helpers can surface the malformed shape as
`ErrUnsupportedCompression` (the more useful diagnostic for AEP-NOSHIP/tests
exercising client behavior). Spec-compliant CLIENT-side rejection
belongs in transport / client-validation tests (the
`internal/store/watchtower/transport/` package's own tests are the
natural home - Task 22+ will add explicit malformed-frame coverage
there as the production validators land), NOT in scenario AEP-NOSHIP/tests
against this harness. Tests asserting end-to-end protocol
compliance should verify their Transport never emits a malformed
EventBatch in the first place; tests should NOT rely on
`BatchAck(0, 0)` for malformed input as a meaningful replay/recovery
signal - it is a harness artifact subject to the fault-injection
rules above.

### Golden vectors - published in two locations

1. `internal/store/watchtower/chain/testdata/vectors.json` - IntegrityRecord canonical-encoding vectors (added in Task 7). These will also be published in `docs/spec/wtp/conformance/` for cross-implementation use.
2. `proto/canyonroad/wtp/v1/testdata/*.bin` - wire-format goldens (CompactEvent, EventBatch, SessionInit). Generated by a small `go run ./internal/store/watchtower/cmd/gen-wire-goldens` tool that we ship in-tree but do not run in CI; CI only verifies that the existing goldens parse + round-trip cleanly.

A test failure on a golden is a load-bearing alarm: the canonical encoding has changed and is now incompatible with every other implementation. The golden test message says exactly this.

### Cross-platform considerations (per AGENTS.md)

- Use `filepath.Join` everywhere. No string concatenation of paths.
- WAL `*.INPROGRESS` rename uses `os.Rename`, which on Windows requires the target not to exist (handled by always renaming a new file into a fresh sealed name).
- `fsync(parent)` calls go through the existing `internal/audit/fsync_dir_{unix,windows}.go` helpers (Windows is a no-op there, which the existing audit chain already accepts).
- bufconn-based tests are cross-platform with no extra effort.
- We do *not* exec anything. No /tmp paths anywhere.

## Deferrals and Open Questions

| Item | Status | Where it shows up in the code |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0: composite shared sequence | Prerequisite | `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-phase-0-shared-sequence-contract.md` is the contract doc; `watchtower.Store.AppendEvent` reads the typed `ev.Chain *types.ChainState` field. |
| Phase 1: OCSF mapper | Prerequisite (hard) | `compact.Mapper` interface; production implementation lives in a different package. The WTP client's `compact/encoder.go` ships a stub `defaultMapper` for unit tests only - production deployment requires `WithMapper(...)` from Phase 1, enforced by `validate()`. |
| Open Q: live key rotation pause/resume | Deferred | Comment in `transport/state.go` at the spot where a `KeyRotation` server message would be handled. The WTP client tolerates session-level `SessionUpdate` (the rotation envelope), so the rotation can be performed by issuing a `SessionUpdate` with a new key fingerprint - the only piece deferred is the *automation* of pausing the chain across the swap. |
| Open Q: OCSF version negotiation | Deferred | Comment in `transport/transport.go` `SessionInit` builder. Today we hard-code `ocsf_version = "1.8.0"` matching the spec. |
| Open Q: sub-second timestamp granularity | Deferred | Comment in `compact/encoder.go` next to the timestamp field. We use uint64 nanoseconds today (already sufficient for nanosecond precision); if the spec lands on a coarser truncation, we'll honour it there. |
| Spec ambiguity #1: loss-only batch sequence range | Flagged for v0.4.10 | Code TODO in `transport/batcher.go` near the `TransportLoss` flush path. We currently emit `from_seq..to_seq` as the missing range and leave the batch's own `sequence_range` covering only the marker record. |
| Spec ambiguity #2: definition of `total_chained` | Flagged for v0.4.10 | Code TODO in `chain/chain.go` next to the SessionInit-building helper. We currently treat it as the count of records the *sink* has chained since installation. |

These deferrals do not block this design. Each is a localized future PR.

## Migration & Rollout

- The sink is **opt-in** via the existing YAML config under `internal/config` (e.g., `audit.watchtower.enabled: true`). It defaults to disabled. The exact YAML schema is added to `internal/config/config.go` as part of this work; see "Prerequisite plumbing" above.
- When disabled, no goroutines start, no disk space is used, and `composite.others` does not include it.
- When enabled but Phase 0 has not landed, `validate()` fails fast with a clear message: `"watchtower sink requires composite shared-sequence support (Phase 0); enable when available"`.
- When enabled but the OCSF mapper is not injected, `validate()` ALSO fails fast: `"watchtower sink requires OCSF mapper (Phase 1); enable when available"`. The stub mapper exists strictly for compile-time and unit-test purposes - production deployment requires Phase 1. (This tightens an earlier inconsistency: the stub is no longer a fallback, it's a test fixture.)

**Mapper nil-handling contract.** `Store.New` must reject both untyped `nil` mappers and typed-nil pointer-to-Mapper implementations. Untyped nil is detected with `m == nil`. For typed-nil, detection is scoped to pointer form via:

```go
rv := reflect.ValueOf(m)
if rv.Kind() == reflect.Ptr && rv.IsNil() {
    return errors.New("mapper is required (typed-nil pointer)")
}
```

Other nilable kinds (`map`, `slice`, `chan`, `func`) implementing `Mapper` are pathological in practice - production mappers are struct pointers (e.g. `*OcsfMapper`) - so the contract intentionally scopes typed-nil rejection to the `*ConcreteMapper` form. If a future implementation deviates from struct-pointer form, the contract should be revisited at that point.

The stub-rejection branch (`compact.IsStubMapper`) runs after the nil branches and matches both value and pointer forms (`StubMapper{}`, `*StubMapper`); the typed-nil `*StubMapper` case is redundantly covered by both branches but the nil branch wins because it produces the more actionable error.

**`compact.Encode` - canonical CompactEvent construction.** All **production sink runtime** construction of `wtpv1.CompactEvent` MUST go through `compact.Encode`. Build-time tooling - golden fixture generators (`internal/store/watchtower/cmd/gen-wire-goldens/fixtures/`), test helpers, intentionally-malformed event generators - MAY construct `CompactEvent` directly when divergence from the canonical encoder is the explicit purpose. The rule exists because the chain step (`chain.Compute`) hashes a fixed canonical projection of the event, so a diverging construction path on the sink runtime path silently breaks integrity verification; tooling that intentionally produces non-canonical messages is exempt.

`Encode` owns these invariants:
- **Mapper must be valid.** `m` must be non-nil and not a typed-nil pointer. Returns `ErrInvalidMapper` otherwise.
- **Chain stamping is mandatory.** `ev.Chain` must be non-nil; the composite store stamps it before fanning out. Returns `ErrMissingChain` otherwise.
- **Timestamp must be valid.** `ev.Timestamp` must be non-zero and ≥ Unix epoch. Pre-epoch instants silently wrap when cast to `uint64`, masking caller bugs. Returns `ErrInvalidTimestamp`.
- **Integrity is left nil.** The chain step populates `Integrity` after computing the entry hash.

`Encode` rejects untyped-nil and typed-nil-pointer mappers via `ErrInvalidMapper`. `Store.New` (Phase 10) performs the same rejection at construction time. This is defense in depth, not redundancy: the runtime nil check is a cheap branch on the hot path, and it makes `Encode` independently safe to call regardless of whether the caller routes through `Store.New`.

Error sentinels are exported so callers can classify with `errors.Is`: `ErrInvalidMapper`, `ErrMissingChain`, `ErrInvalidTimestamp`. Mapper failures are wrapped with `fmt.Errorf("compact mapper: %w", err)` so `errors.Unwrap` returns the underlying mapper error.

Encode failures in the WTP sink's `AppendEvent` path are classified via `errors.Is`. Three classes - `ErrInvalidMapper`, `ErrInvalidTimestamp`, and the default mapper-failure branch - are dropped silently (chain does NOT advance) and counted via per-class counters (`wtp_dropped_invalid_mapper_total`, `wtp_dropped_invalid_timestamp_total`, `wtp_dropped_mapper_failure_total`). The fourth class - `ErrMissingChain` - is NOT dropped: it is propagated to the caller as `fmt.Errorf("watchtower: %w", err)` because a missing chain indicates a composite-store regression that operators must surface loudly. See Task 22a for the metric definitions and Task 23 for the sink-side `errors.Is` wiring.

The three drop classes (`ErrInvalidMapper`, `ErrInvalidTimestamp`, mapper-failure default branch) follow the same boundary contract as the existing per-record drops `wtp_dropped_invalid_utf8_total` (see "per-record encodes only" paragraph above) and `wtp_dropped_sequence_overflow_total` (see sequence-width contract paragraph above):

- **WAL**: drops happen before WAL admission. The WAL is not touched - no segment write, no INPROGRESS lifecycle event, no replay-side accounting.
- **Chain**: `prev_hash` does not advance; the SinkChain is not committed. The chain remains at the same state it occupied before the dropped record.
- **Sequence**: the sequence allocated by the composite store IS consumed (the composite stamps `ev.Chain` before fanning out to each sink). A gap therefore appears in the WTP-observed chain relative to other sinks (JSONL, OTEL) which committed the same allocated sequence. Operators reading WTP output must tolerate gaps; whether to surface those gaps as `TransportLoss` markers (and with what reason code) is deferred to Phase 8 alongside the existing `invalid_utf8` gap-handling decision. The `ErrMissingChain` propagation path does NOT consume a sequence - it returns to the caller before any allocator-coupled state advances - so it cannot create a sequence gap.
- **Log**: structured WARN log emitted with fields `{session_id, sequence, generation, err}`. The `err` value is the wrapped error returned by `Encode`; its message identifies the specific failure (e.g. `compact: invalid mapper`, `compact mapper: <underlying>`).
- **AppendEvent return**: returns `nil` for the three drop classes (sink-internal drop, not propagated to the caller - matches the existing `invalid_utf8` and `sequence_overflow` patterns above). The metric and the structured log are the only signals operators see.

The `default` branch of the `errors.Is` switch - i.e., `Encode` returned an error that is not one of the four sentinels - corresponds to a mapper-side failure wrapped by `Encode` as `compact mapper: %w`. That branch increments `wtp_dropped_mapper_failure_total`. There is no fifth sentinel for this case because the underlying error originates inside the mapper implementation; operators classify it from the wrapped `err` text in the structured log.

The `ErrMissingChain` branch is NOT a drop. `AppendEvent` returns `fmt.Errorf("watchtower: %w", err)` AND emits one ERROR-severity structured log per occurrence with fields `{event_id, session_id, event_type, err}`. None of those fields are peer-supplied - `ev.Chain == nil` is composite-store internal state, all four logged values come from sink-side bookkeeping or fixed sentinel strings, not protocol input - so the log is exempt from the invalid-frame sanitization rule that bans peer-supplied bytes. There is NO per-sink counter for this branch (a missing chain is a developer-visible composite-store regression, not a runtime drop class - operators surface it at the call site rather than in a metric series). The composite store MUST stamp `ev.Chain` before fanout - failing to do so is a programming error, and propagating it lets the caller surface the regression at the call site rather than burying it. There is no rate-limit, sampling, or first-N suppression on this log: every occurrence is a separate composite-store invariant violation worth surfacing. `generation` is intentionally NOT included because composite-store generation is only available via `ev.Chain.Generation`, which is nil on this branch by definition. If operators need to correlate which generation a missing-chain event corresponds to, they should cross-reference `session_id` and `event_id` against the composite-store's session log.

**Caller contract for propagated `compact.ErrMissingChain`.** This error is a developer-facing diagnostic, not an operator-facing throughput failure - composite did not stamp `ev.Chain`, which is a programming/integration bug, not a runtime/transport problem. The watchtower sink and its callers MUST therefore treat the propagated error as follows:

(a) The watchtower sink MUST log the error at ERROR severity once per occurrence (no rate-limit or de-duplication suppression for the first N - every instance is a separate composite-store invariant violation worth surfacing). The log carries fields `{event_id, session_id, event_type, err}` and ONLY those fields, all sourced from `types.Event` itself or a fixed sentinel string - none are peer-supplied:

  - `event_id` is `ev.ID` (logged verbatim, including the empty string when `ev.ID` is empty - do not invent a substitute). The Go-side field on `types.Event` is `ID`; the log key is `event_id` for operator readability.
  - `session_id` is `ev.SessionID` - internal-only, useful for correlating which session's composite failed to stamp.
  - `event_type` is `ev.Type` - internal-only, helps operators see what category of event slipped through without a chain stamp.
  - `err` is `compact.ErrMissingChain.Error()` - the sentinel error string itself, no peer-supplied content; this is a fixed-format internal error.

  `generation` is intentionally NOT included because composite-store generation is only available via `ev.Chain.Generation`, which is nil on this branch by definition. If operators need to correlate which generation a missing-chain event corresponds to, they should cross-reference `session_id` and `event_id` against the composite-store's session log. The log MUST NOT include `payload`, `mapper_err`, the raw event body, or any other peer-derived content. The sanitization rule that bans peer-supplied bytes from invalid-frame logs does not apply here only because every field is internal-only; if `types.Event.ID` or `SessionID` were ever populated by the peer, the field set would have to shrink accordingly.
(b) The sink MUST NOT auto-disable, self-shutdown, or latch fatal on this error. Disabling the sink is an operator decision, not a per-event response. The sink continues to accept subsequent `AppendEvent` calls; if the composite stamps `ev.Chain` correctly on the next event, processing resumes normally.
(c) The sink MAY return the error up the audit pipeline so the composite store has the option to crash-fail in dev/test builds (where invariant violations should be loud) while production builds log and continue. The decision is the composite's, not the WTP sink's.
(d) The error is NOT retryable. Re-encoding the same event with the same `ev.Chain == nil` will produce the same `compact.ErrMissingChain`. Callers MUST NOT loop, back off, or schedule the event for re-delivery - the only remediation is fixing the composite's stamping logic and re-running with a corrected event.

The contrast with the silent-drop classes is intentional: `ErrInvalidMapper`, `ErrInvalidTimestamp`, and the mapper-failure default branch are operator-visible runtime conditions (event source corruption, mapper bugs) where the sink absorbs the failure and counts it; `ErrMissingChain` is a developer-visible integration condition where the sink refuses to absorb the failure because doing so would mask the upstream bug.

**Mapper error sanitization.** Mapper implementations MUST NOT include event payload bytes, raw payload values, or secret material in error strings. The full error string is emitted in structured WARN logs verbatim and (for `ErrMissingChain`) returned through `AppendEvent`'s wrapped error to the caller. Mappers should return descriptive but non-sensitive errors (e.g., `unsupported event type: <type>` rather than `failed to map: <full payload>`). The default `StubMapper` does not return errors. Production mappers must follow this contract; callers cannot sanitize after the fact. Mapper authors should add an explicit code-review checklist item for error-string content.

- Operators can verify the sink end-to-end without a live Watchtower by pointing `Endpoint` at the testserver binary that ships in `cmd/wtp-testserver/` (a thin wrapper around `internal/store/watchtower/testserver`). This is also how we recommend running it in development.

## Implementation Phases

This section enumerates ordered milestones with one-line entry/exit criteria, scaffolding the `writing-plans` follow-up. Each phase is independently reviewable and produces a green CI build.

| # | Phase | Entry | Exit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Phase 0 contract land** | Phase 0 contract doc approved. | `audit.SequenceAllocator` and `audit.SinkChain` exist with full unit tests. `audit.IntegrityChain.Wrap` preserved (existing tests green). `pkg/types.Event.Chain *ChainState` added with `json:"-"` tag. `TestEvent_ChainFieldNotMarshaled` passes. |
| 2 | **Composite refactor** | Phase 1 done. | `composite.Store` constructs a `SequenceAllocator`, stamps `ev.Chain` before fanout, exposes `NextGeneration()`. Cross-sink `(seq, gen)` convergence test passes. Single-sink installations behave identically (no observable change). |
| 3 | **Filter + config + metrics plumbing** | Phase 2 done. | `internal/store/eventfilter/` package generalized from OTEL's private filter (OTEL still passes its own tests). `WatchtowerConfig` schema added to `internal/config/config.go` with default-expansion and validation tests. `wtp_*` metrics registered with `internal/metrics.Collector`. |
| 4a-i | **Proto scaffolding** | Phase 3 done. | `proto/canyonroad/wtp/v1/wtp.proto` defined matching spec §7. Generated `wtp.pb.go` and `wtp_grpc.pb.go` committed. Smoke round-trip test passes. |
| 4a-ii | **Schema stability + validators** | Phase 4a-i done. | Schema-stability policy recorded in spec (pre-1.0 unstable). Receiver-side validators in `proto/canyonroad/wtp/v1/validate.go` reject unset `EventBatch.body`, body/compression mismatch, COMPRESSION_UNSPECIFIED, HASH_ALGORITHM_UNSPECIFIED, and over-cap compressed payloads. Negative tests cover every rejection path. |
| 4b | **Wire goldens** | Phase 4a done. | `proto/canyonroad/wtp/v1/testdata/*.bin` goldens generated by in-tree `cmd/gen-wire-goldens` and verified to round-trip in CI (`TestWireGoldens_RoundTrip`). |
| 5 | **Chain helpers** | Phase 4 done. | `internal/store/watchtower/chain/` package: `EncodeCanonical`, `ComputeContextDigest`, `ComputeEventHash`. `chain/testdata/vectors.json` goldens published (cross-implementation conformance suite). All pure unit tests green. |
| 6 | **Compact encoder + mapper interface** | Phase 5 done. | `compact.Mapper` interface defined. Stub mapper for unit tests only. Per-OCSF-class projection helpers tested against `compact/payload/testdata/*.json`. |
| 7 | **WAL package** | Phase 6 done. | `internal/store/watchtower/wal/`: segment header, framing, CRC32C, atomic seal, INPROGRESS lifecycle, meta.json, Reader API. **Required tests**: `TestWAL_RolloverAndReplay`, `TestWAL_GenerationBoundaryOrdering`, `TestWAL_CRCFailureEmitsCoarseLossRange`, `TestWAL_OverflowEmitsLossMarker`. |
| 8 | **Transport state machine** | Phase 7 done. | `internal/store/watchtower/transport/`: Conn interface, Dialer pattern, four-state machine, Batcher with all six invariants, Replayer, Heartbeat. Mock-Conn-driven table tests cover every (state × event) cell. |
| 9 | **In-tree testserver** | Phase 8 done. | `internal/store/watchtower/testserver/`: bufconn server, scenario hooks (Drop, Goaway, AckDelay, SessionAckSeq/Generation, RejectSession), `WaitForFirstBatch` / `AssertSequenceRange` / `AssertReplayObserved` helpers. Self-tested. |
| 10 | **Store integration + transactional Append** | Phase 9 done. | `internal/store/watchtower/store.go` glues compact + chain + wal + transport. Implements `store.EventStore`. **Required tests**: `TestStore_WALCleanFailure_NoChainAdvance`, `TestStore_WALAmbiguousFailure_LatchesFatal`. |
| 11 | **Component + integration tests** | Phase 10 done. | The five-layer pyramid's component and integration rows pass: `TestStore_DropsMidBatchTriggersReplay`, `TestStore_ServerRestart_AcksCatchUp`, plus the testserver-driven scenario suite. |
| 12 | **Daemon wiring** | Phase 11 done. | `cmd/aep-caw` constructs a WTP `Store` when `audit.watchtower.enabled: true`, passes `WithMapper`, `WithMetrics`, `WithLogger`, `WithChainKey`. Manual end-to-end smoke test against `cmd/wtp-testserver` documented. |

Phases 5/6/7/8 can be parallelized across contributors after Phase 4b (the proto definitions are the only shared dependency). Phases 1/2/3 are strict sequential prerequisites.

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Canonical encoding drift breaks every other implementation. | Golden vectors are mandatory for every change to `chain/canonical.go`. Vectors are also published as the conformance suite. |
| WAL grows unbounded if server is offline forever. | `max_total_bytes` is hard-capped; oldest unacked drops with `TransportLoss`. Marker is fsynced before the drop is reported as complete. |
| State-machine bugs deadlock the transport goroutine. | All select branches have a `ctx.Done()` arm. Heartbeat miss timer is independent of inbound traffic. State machine has full table-test coverage of every (state × event) cell. |
| Fsync cost on the hot path regresses end-to-end latency (cf. `2026-04-13-deferred-sync`). | Default WAL sync mode is `immediate`, but we expose `deferred` with the same 100ms tick used for the existing JSONL/sidecar path. Operators with the same constraints can opt in. |
| gRPC connection establishment blocks startup. | Dial happens in a background goroutine; `New` returns immediately. The first `AppendEvent` does not wait for connection - the WAL absorbs records until the transport catches up. |
| Cross-platform regressions in WAL atomic-rename or dir-fsync. | The same helpers as the existing JSONL/integrity sidecar; they are already in production on all three OSes. |

## Out-of-Scope (Explicit)

- Server implementation (Watchtower).
- Compressed-batch encoding/decoding. The MVP client always emits `Compression_COMPRESSION_NONE`; the proto enum reserves space for `ZSTD`/`GZIP` and the spec records the size caps, but no compression code path is implemented in this cycle.
- Phase 0 composite refactor (separate doc).
- Phase 1 OCSF mapper (separate work).
- Live key rotation automation.
- mTLS automation, SPIFFE, cert rotation.
- HTTP/2 fallback.
- Multi-tenant routing.
- Querying acked events back from the server (one-way only).
- Backfill from existing JSONL/SQLite stores into WTP.
