# Tor Access Control - Design

**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Status:** Approved - Phase 1 + Phase 2 implemented
**Related:** `internal/policy/engine.go` (`CheckExecve`, `CheckNetworkIP`,
`CheckNetworkCtx`), `internal/netmonitor/dns.go`, `internal/netmonitor/proxy.go`,
`internal/netmonitor/transparent_tcp.go`, `internal/threatfeed/`,
`internal/config/config.go`, `internal/events/types.go`,
`internal/ocsf/registry.go`. Builds on the connect-redirect machinery
(`docs/plans/2026-01-29-network-redirect-design.md`) and the Process
Network ACL (`docs/plans/2026-01-13-process-network-acl-design.md`).

## Summary

Add a top-level **`tor:` policy block** that gives aep-caw a single,
declarative, **deny-by-default** posture toward the Tor network. The
block is a *coordinating macro*: one intent (`deny | audit | allow`)
expands into consistent enforcement across the five distinct ways a
sandboxed process can reach Tor, and every hit emits a uniform
`tor_control` audit event tagged with the vector that fired.

The threat is evasion: an AI agent that runs `tor` (or `torsocks`, a
bridge, a SOCKS proxy) to tunnel around aep-caw's carefully-built
network egress allowlist. Tor traffic is encrypted to relays, so once
an agent is on the Tor network its real destinations are invisible to
every IP/DNS/host control aep-caw has. The only effective response is
to stop the agent reaching the Tor network in the first place.

**Deny-by-default.** With no `tor:` block configured at all, Tor is
denied. Operators must explicitly opt out (`tor.mode: allow` or
`tor.enabled: false`) to permit it. The default posture requires **no
external network fetch** - it relies on the four cheap doors (client
binaries, local SOCKS/control ports, `.onion` DNS, `.onion` HTTP) plus
a built-in set of Tor directory-authority IPs that alone break Tor
bootstrap.

Phase 1 (this spec, the deliverable) is **category control**: block or
audit Tor as a whole. Phase 2 (sketched, not built) is a SOCKS-aware
onion gateway for per-`.onion` allow/deny when Tor is deliberately
permitted.

## Motivation

aep-caw's network controls - PNACL, `CheckNetworkIP/Ctx`, threat
feeds, the HTTP/DB proxies - all reason about a connection's
*destination*: its host, IP, CIDR, port, SNI, or HTTP Host. Tor
defeats all of them at once. An agent that bootstraps a Tor client
opens an encrypted circuit to a guard relay and then reaches anything
- including any `.onion` service and any clearnet host - with the real
target buried inside the encrypted stream. From aep-caw's vantage the
only thing visible is "a TLS connection to some relay IP," and the
agent's entire egress policy is bypassed.

Tor is therefore best treated as a *category* to be denied by default,
the same way the socket-family-block spec treats niche kernel socket
families: near-zero legitimate use inside an agent workload, high
evasion value, so deny unless explicitly needed.

The good news is that four of the five enforcement points already
exist; this design coordinates them and adds one new primitive
(IP/CIDR membership) plus the feed that populates it.

## The five vectors

A process reaches Tor through exactly one (or more) of these doors.
Phase 1 closes all five.

| # | Vector | What it catches | Hook |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Client processes** | Agent runs `tor`/`obfs4proxy`/`snowflake-client`/`lyrebird`/`meek-client`/`torsocks`/Tor Browser | `CheckExecve` → ptrace deny (**exists**) |
| 2 | **Local SOCKS/control ports** | App speaks SOCKS to a local Tor daemon at `127.0.0.1:9050/9150`, control at `9051` | `connect()` seccomp-notify, sees loopback sockaddr (**exists, small wiring**) |
| 3 | **`.onion` DNS** | A `.onion` name (RFC 7686) reaches the resolver | DNS interceptor name match → REFUSED (**exists**) |
| 4 | **`.onion` HTTP** | A `.onion` Host fetched through aep-caw's HTTP proxy | proxy Host match → 403 (**exists**) |
| 5 | **Relay IPs** | The Tor daemon dials guard / middle / exit / dir-authority IPs directly | IP/CIDR match in `CheckNetworkIP` (**net-new**) |

Vectors 1-4 do not depend on any feed. Vector 5 uses a built-in
directory-authority seed (feed-independent) plus an optional onionoo
relay feed.

The `.onion` DNS (3) and `.onion` HTTP (4) rows are two enforcement
points and two distinct `tor_control` event vectors (`onion_dns`,
`onion_http`), but they share a single `vectors.onion` config toggle:
blocking `.onion` over DNS while permitting it over the HTTP proxy is
incoherent, so one toggle governs both. The other vectors remain
independently toggleable.

## Non-Goals

- **Per-`.onion` allow/deny in Phase 1.** Allowing `a.onion` while
  denying `b.onion` through the *same* local Tor requires reading the
  `.onion` target out of the SOCKS5 CONNECT handshake - a stateful
  MITM proxy. Deferred to Phase 2. Phase 1 blocking an onion is free
  (kill the transport); *permitting a specific* onion is the hard part.
- **Enumerating private bridges.** Bridges are deliberately unlisted,
  so the relay-IP feed cannot know them. Bridge-based Tor is still
  caught by vectors 1-4 (the agent still runs a client binary and
  dials a local SOCKS port). Relay-IP blocking is defense-in-depth for
  the daemon's *direct* egress, not the sole control. Documented, not
  pretended.
- **Per-port precision on relay IPs.** Relay-IP matching (vector 5) is
  IP-based and **port-agnostic**: a connection to *any* port of a seed
  or feed relay IP is treated as Tor. A few directory-authority IPs sit
  in netblocks shared with non-Tor services, so under deny-by-default a
  sandboxed agent that legitimately dials such an IP on an unrelated
  port is blocked as `relay_ip`. This is the intended conservative
  posture (the same trade-off as the bridge limitation); the operator's
  escape hatch is `vectors.relay_ips: false` or `tor.mode: audit`.
- **Deep Tor protocol fingerprinting** (recognizing the Tor link
  handshake on an arbitrary TLS connection). Out of scope; the five
  vectors above are cheaper and sufficient.
- **Mandatory phone-home.** The onionoo feed is opt-in. The
  deny-by-default posture must hold with zero external fetches.
- **Replacing PNACL / threat feeds / network rules.** The `tor:` block
  sits alongside them and takes precedence in `deny` mode; it does not
  subsume general network policy.
- **Non-Linux enforcement parity.** Enforcement is Linux-first
  (matches the repo posture). Cross-platform hooks that already exist
  (execve, DNS, HTTP proxy) carry over; the `connect()`/relay-IP path
  rides the Linux seccomp/network layer. The config parses everywhere
  (cross-compile builds clean); platforms without the underlying
  subsystem degrade per "Honest scope" below.

## Configuration

New top-level block, sibling of `threat_feeds` and `policies`:

```yaml
tor:
  # Tri-state, codebase convention (*bool): absent/nil → true.
  # Deny-by-default: omitting the whole block denies Tor.
  enabled: true

  # deny (default) | audit | allow
  #   deny  → on a Tor match, short-circuit to deny; emit tor_control{decision:deny}
  #   audit → on a Tor match, do NOT block on account of Tor; emit
  #           tor_control{decision:audit}, then fall through to normal
  #           policy (a user rule may still deny it - audit never loosens)
  #   allow → Tor vectors are no-ops (Tor permitted); normal policy still
  #           applies to non-Tor traffic. Phase 2 attaches onion_rules here.
  mode: deny

  # All default true. Lets an operator relax one door without losing the rest.
  vectors:
    processes:   true
    socks_ports: true
    onion:       true   # one toggle for both .onion DNS and .onion HTTP
    relay_ips:   true

  client_binaries: [tor, obfs4proxy, snowflake-client, lyrebird, meek-client, torsocks]
  socks_ports:     [9050, 9150]
  control_ports:   [9051]
  socks_loopback_only: true   # only treat those ports as Tor when dest is loopback

  relay_feed:
    enabled: false            # opt-in; deny-by-default does NOT require this
    sources: ["https://onionoo.torproject.org/details"]
    local_lists: ["/etc/aep-caw/tor-relays.txt"]
    sync_interval: 6h
```

**Defaults resolution (`ResolveTorConfig`).** A missing block, or
`enabled` unset, resolves to `enabled: true, mode: deny` with all
vectors on and the built-in seed active. Empty `mode` → `deny`. This
mirrors the `*bool` tri-state already used for `WaitKillable` and the
"unset → recommended default" pattern in the socket-family-block spec.

**Escape hatches.** `tor.enabled: false` disables Tor controls
entirely; `tor.mode: allow` permits Tor (and, in Phase 2, scopes it
via `onion_rules`).

**Upgrade / migration note (deny-by-default activates on upgrade).**
Because `tor:` is deny-by-default, an existing deployment whose config
has **no `tor:` block** will, on upgrade to a build containing this
feature, immediately begin denying all five Tor vectors - client
binaries, the local SOCKS/control ports (`9050/9150/9051`), `.onion`
DNS/HTTP, and the built-in directory-authority IPs - for agents that
never opted in. This is the intended posture, not a regression. An
operator who needs Tor, or who wants a gentler rollout, must set one of
the following **before** upgrading:

- `tor.mode: audit` - observe via `tor_control{decision:audit}` events
  without blocking, then tighten to `deny` once the impact is understood;
  or
- `tor.enabled: false` - disable the Tor controls entirely.

This default-on, high-impact behavior change **must be called out in the
release notes** for the version that ships Phase 1, so operators can opt
out ahead of time.

## Architecture

### Coordinator, not rule synthesis

Two ways to expand the macro were considered:

- **(A, chosen) Dedicated checks consulting a shared `tor.Policy`.**
  Each enforcement point asks `tor.Policy` "is this Tor, and what's the
  mode?" before normal rule evaluation. A Tor match in `deny` mode
  overrides any user `allow`. Every hit emits a uniform `tor_control`
  event tagged with its vector. One config source of truth; clean
  precedence; Tor-specific observability.
- **(B, rejected) Rule synthesis.** Generate ordinary
  execve/network/DNS rules from the `tor:` block at load. Less wiring,
  but events surface as generic "network deny," precedence with user
  rules is murky, and there is no "Tor" concept in the audit trail.

`tor.Policy` (new, `internal/tor/`) holds the resolved config, the
compiled client-binary matchers, the port sets, and the relay IP set.
It exposes:

- `EvalExecve(path, argv) (TorVerdict, ok)`
- `EvalConnect(ip, port) (TorVerdict, ok)` - covers both SOCKS/control
  ports (vector 2) and relay IPs (vector 5)
- `EvalOnionName(host) (TorVerdict, ok)` - covers `.onion` for DNS and
  HTTP (vectors 3, 4)

`TorVerdict` carries `{vector, mode, decision, target}`. `ok=false`
means "not Tor, fall through to normal policy." The existing
enforcement points each gain a short pre-check that calls the relevant
`Eval*` and, on `ok`, applies the verdict and emits the event.

### Per-vector integration

1. **Processes** - `CheckExecve` calls `EvalExecve`. Match (basename or
   path glob against `client_binaries`) in `deny` mode → existing deny
   path (`EACCES`). `audit` → allow + event.
2. **SOCKS/control ports** - the `connect()` seccomp-notify handler
   calls `EvalConnect`. Port ∈ `socks_ports ∪ control_ports` (and, if
   `socks_loopback_only`, dest is loopback) → deny/audit. This path,
   not iptables transparent redirect, is what sees loopback
   destinations.
3. **`.onion` DNS** - the DNS interceptor calls `EvalOnionName` on the
   parsed QNAME. `.onion` suffix in `deny` mode → REFUSED response.
4. **`.onion` HTTP** - the HTTP proxy calls `EvalOnionName` on the
   extracted Host. `.onion` in `deny` mode → 403.
5. **Relay IPs** - `CheckNetworkIP` calls `EvalConnect`; on relay-IP
   membership in `deny` mode → deny. (Net-new; see below.)

### Precedence and fail-closed

- In `deny` mode a Tor verdict **short-circuits to deny** and overrides
  any user `allow` rule at the same enforcement point - Tor checks run
  first.
- In `audit` mode a Tor verdict emits the event and **falls through**
  to normal policy; it never loosens a decision a user rule would make
  (a user `deny` still denies).
- In `allow` mode the Tor vectors are no-ops; normal network policy is
  unchanged for non-Tor traffic.
- Vectors 1-4 are independent of any feed; each holds even if the
  others or the feed are unavailable. (The `.onion` DNS and HTTP
  enforcement points share the single `vectors.onion` toggle - see "The
  five vectors" - but are otherwise independent doors.)
- If the relay feed fails to load: fall back to last-good disk cache →
  built-in directory-authority seed + `local_lists`. Never silent
  fail-open. A `tor_control` feed-status warning is logged/metered.

### Honest scope (subsystem dependence)

Default-deny is enforced **per vector whose underlying subsystem is
active**: vector 1 needs execve monitoring; vectors 2 and 5 need the
connect/network interception layer; vector 3 needs the DNS
interceptor; vector 4 needs the HTTP proxy. Where a subsystem is
disabled, that door degrades to no-op (in `deny`) or is simply not
observed. This is documented rather than papered over; the spec does
not claim a door it cannot enforce.

## The net-new mechanism: IP/CIDR membership + relay feed

The threat-feed store matches **domains only** (`Check(domain)`), and
`CheckNetworkIP` has no feed check today. Rather than overload the
threat-feed subsystem with IP semantics, add a small reusable
primitive and let `tor.Policy` own its relay set.

- **`internal/ipset` (new, small).** Efficient IPv4/IPv6 + CIDR
  membership (sorted ranges or a binary trie). Reusable; the
  threat-feed store may adopt it later.
- **`tor.Policy.IsRelay(ip)`** consults that set; wired into
  `CheckNetworkIP` only when `vectors.relay_ips` is on.
- **Built-in seed (feed-independent).** The ~9 Tor directory-authority
  IPs plus bundled fallback-dir IPs ship hardcoded. A Tor client must
  reach a dir authority / fallback dir to bootstrap, so this alone
  breaks Tor - and it needs no fetch, which is what makes
  deny-by-default work out of the box.
- **Feed source: onionoo** (`onionoo.torproject.org/details`, the Tor
  Project's official API). Parse every relay's `or_addresses` into the
  set - **all relays, not just exits**, because the local daemon dials
  *guard* (entry) nodes first; blocking only exits would not stop
  bootstrap. Disk-cached, `sync_interval` refresh (default 6h),
  `local_lists` for curated/air-gapped IPs. The feed dataset is large
  (~8k relays); the loader streams/parses to the `ipset` and caches the
  compiled set to disk (reuse the threatfeed syncer/cache pattern).
- **Limitation:** bridges are unlisted (see Non-Goals).

## Events / observability

One new event type:

```
EventTorControl events.EventType = "tor_control"
```

Fields: `vector` (`process|socks_port|onion_dns|onion_http|relay_ip`),
`mode` (`deny|audit|allow`), `decision` (`deny|audit|allow`), `target`
(binary path / `.onion` host / `ip:port`), `rule: "tor"`, plus the
standard base process fields (pid, process name, executable, cmdline,
uid/gid, username). `audit` mode emits the same event with
`decision: audit`.

**Attribution caveat.** The `pid`/`command_id` fields are populated only
where the firing enforcement layer knows the originating process. The
ptrace execve and network paths carry a real `pid` (with an empty
`command_id`, matching the sibling `ptrace_execve`/`ptrace_network`
events). The DNS, HTTP-proxy, and transparent-TCP layers operate on a
query/connection and emit `pid: 0`, because the originating PID is not
resolved at that layer; those records are correlated by session and
`target` instead. Threading a PID into those layers is possible future
work, not a Phase 1 guarantee.

**Registration requirement.** Any new `events.EventType` must also be
added to `internal/ocsf/registry.go` (`pendingTypes` or a real OCSF
class mapping), or `TestExhaustiveness_AllEventTypesRegistered` fails -
in a package this change does not otherwise touch. A full
`go test ./...` is therefore part of "done." Map `tor_control` to an
appropriate OCSF network/security-finding class in the registry.

Feed status (loaded / stale / failed, relay-set size, last sync) goes
to logs and metrics, **not** a second event type - keeping the OCSF
surface to one new type.

## Testing

**Unit**
- `tor.Policy` decisions across every vector × mode (`deny/audit/allow`).
- `ipset` membership: IPv4, IPv6, CIDR boundaries, empty set.
- onionoo parser: `or_addresses` extraction, IPv6 forms, malformed input.
- Precedence: a Tor `deny` verdict overrides a user `allow` rule.
- Degraded path: feed disabled/empty → built-in dir-authority seed
  still blocks; feed fetch failure → last-good cache used, warning emitted.
- Defaults resolution: absent block → `enabled+deny+all vectors`.

**Integration (Linux)**
- Fake `tor` binary → exec denied (`EACCES`) + one `tor_control` event.
- Fake SOCKS listener on `127.0.0.1:9050` → `connect()` denied.
- `.onion` DNS query → REFUSED.
- `.onion` fetch via the HTTP proxy → 403.
- `connect()` to a seeded relay IP → denied.
- `audit` mode → each of the above is permitted but emits a
  `tor_control{decision:audit}` event.
- One `tor_control` event per fired vector, with correct `vector`/`target`.

**Gates**
- Full `go test ./...` (OCSF exhaustiveness lives outside the changed packages).
- `GOOS=windows go build ./...` cross-compile (per CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md).
- roborev between tasks; fix everything above low before proceeding.

## Phase 2 (onion gateway - implemented)

When `tor.mode: allow` and an `onion_rules:` list is present, aep-caw
becomes a **managed Tor egress**:

1. Redirect the app→`127.0.0.1:9050` connection, via the existing
   connect-redirect machinery, into aep-caw's own SOCKS5 front-end.
2. New `internal/netmonitor/socks.go` parses the SOCKS5 greeting +
   CONNECT request and extracts the target host (`.onion` or clearnet).
3. Match the target against `onion_rules` (and clearnet-via-Tor rules)
   through `tor.Policy`.
4. Allowed streams are forwarded to the *real* Tor SOCKS daemon;
   denied streams are reset. Stateful, fail-closed.

Reuses connect-redirect, `tor.Policy`, and the `tor_control` event
schema (new `vector: onion`). This is the only path that yields true
per-`.onion` granularity, and it is deferred until there is a concrete
need to *permit* specific onions rather than block Tor wholesale.

```yaml
# Phase 2 illustration only - not parsed in Phase 1.
tor:
  mode: allow
  onion_rules:
    - onion: "abcdefghij…234567.onion"
      decision: allow
    - onion: "*"
      decision: deny
```

**Honest scope (Phase 2).** Per-`.onion` filtering applies to Tor SOCKS
connections that reach aep-caw's transparent-TCP interceptor (original
destination = a configured `socks_ports` entry). A `.onion`/clearnet target
matching no `onion_rules` entry is denied (fail-closed); allowed targets are
forwarded to the real Tor SOCKS daemon at `127.0.0.1:<socks_ports[0]>`. In
sandbox modes where the app reaches a loopback Tor daemon that is *not* within
aep-caw's interception, allow-mode degrades to Phase-1 allow (Tor permitted,
unfiltered) - the operator must route the Tor SOCKS port through aep-caw's
transparent interception for the gateway to take effect. The gateway emits one
`tor_control{vector: onion, decision: allow|deny}` event per CONNECT; like the
other connection-layer vectors it reports `pid: 0` and is correlated by session
and target.

**Phase 3 (fail-open gap closed - implemented).** The silent degrade described
above is closed: in netns transparent mode a loopback-DNAT force-redirect steers
the app's Tor SOCKS connection into the gateway automatically; in any mode where
the gateway cannot be wired the session fails closed (Tor denied, `tor_control`
`vector: gateway` audit event). See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-20-tor-access-control-phase3-design.md`.
