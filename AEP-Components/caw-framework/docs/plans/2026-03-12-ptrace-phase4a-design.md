# Ptrace Phase 4a: Core Steering Engine - Design

**Date:** 2026-03-12
**Author:** Eran / Canyon Road
**Status:** Implemented (2026-03-13)

---

## Overview

Phase 4a adds syscall-level redirect/steering to the ptrace backend, bringing it to feature parity with seccomp+FUSE for the core enforcement behaviors: exec redirect, file path redirect, soft-delete, and connect redirect.

All steering builds on a new **syscall injection engine** - the ability to execute arbitrary syscalls inside a stopped tracee. This is the same technique used by CRIU, strace, and Datadog CWS.

## 1. Syscall Injection Engine

### Foundation

`injectSyscall(pid, nr, args)` executes an arbitrary syscall in a stopped tracee:

1. Save the tracee's current register state
2. Write new register values (syscall nr + args)
3. Set IP to a known `syscall` instruction in the tracee's address space
4. Resume with `PtraceSyscall` → wait for syscall-enter stop
5. Resume with `PtraceSyscall` → wait for syscall-exit stop
6. Read return value from registers
7. Restore original register state

Uses the two-phase PtraceSyscall approach (not PtraceSingleStep) - immune to seccomp prefilter interactions and signal delivery races.

### Syscall Gadget Discovery

**Primary (Option C): Reuse current IP.** When the tracee is stopped at a syscall-enter or PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP, IP points right after the `syscall` instruction. `IP - 2` on amd64 / `IP - 4` on arm64 is the instruction itself. Zero cost, no memory writes. Works for all injection that happens during syscall interception - which covers all our use cases.

**Fallback: VDSO scan.** For edge cases where the tracee isn't at a syscall stop (e.g., PTRACE_INTERRUPT), scan the VDSO for a `syscall; ret` gadget. Cache per-tracee, invalidate on exec (ASLR remaps the VDSO).

### Architecture Support

Add to `Regs` interface (amd64 + arm64):
- `Clone() Regs`
- `SetArg(index int, val uint64)`
- `SetInstructionPointer(addr uint64)`
- `InstructionPointer() uint64`
- `ReturnValue() int64`

## 2. Scratch Page Allocation

For file path redirect where the replacement path is longer than the original.

**Strategy: mmap injection (Strategy B from spec).**

1. First time a tracee needs scratch: inject `mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0)`. Cache the address.
2. Bump-allocate within the page for each string write.
3. Reset `used = 0` at each new syscall-enter stop - the kernel has consumed the data.
4. Invalidate on exec (address space remapped).

**Per-TGID, not per-TID.** Threads in the same process share address space, so one mmap serves all threads. Avoids redundant mmap injection in multi-threaded tracees.

Only file redirect needs scratch regularly. Connect redirect uses fixed-size sockaddr (always fits in-place). Exec redirect writes short stub paths that typically fit in the original buffer.

## 3. Exec Redirect

When `ExecHandler.Handle()` returns `ActionRedirect`:

### Sequence

1. **Create socketpair** in the tracer process (for stub communication)
2. **Inject fd** into tracee at fd 100 via `pidfd_getfd` (kernel 5.6+, Fargate runs 5.10+):
   - Inject `pidfd_open(tracer_pid, 0)` → pidfd
   - Inject `pidfd_getfd(pidfd, src_fd, 0)` → copy socketpair fd into tracee
   - Inject `dup3(got_fd, 100, 0)` → place at fd 100
   - Inject `close(pidfd)` + `close(got_fd)` → clean up temporaries
3. **Write stub path** into tracee memory (overwrite original filename, or use scratch if longer)
4. **Update registers** so kernel executes `execve` with stub path
5. **Resume** - stub runs, finds fd 100, connects back to tracer

### Stub Binary Location

**Option A (recommended for now):** Bind-mount the stub from the sidecar container via shared volume, configured in the ECS task definition / K8s pod spec. Simple, matches the deployment model.

**Option B (future):** Write stub into tracee memory via `memfd_create` + `execveat(fd, "", AT_EMPTY_PATH)` - entirely ptrace-injected, no filesystem dependency.

### Error Handling

If any injection step fails mid-sequence: restore saved registers, close any fds already injected via `close` injection, fall back to `denySyscall(tid, EACCES)`. Never leave the tracee in a half-modified state.

## 4. File Path Redirect

When `FileHandler.Handle()` returns `ActionRedirect`:

1. Read path from tracee memory at the pointer in the path argument
2. If replacement fits in original buffer length → overwrite in-place via `writeString`
3. If longer → allocate from scratch page, write path there, update register to new pointer
4. Resume - kernel executes the syscall with the redirected path

Works for all file syscalls from Phase 2: `openat`, `openat2`, `unlinkat`, `renameat2`, `mkdirat`, `linkat`, `symlinkat`, `fchmodat`, `fchownat`. Path argument position varies by syscall but is already mapped in the Phase 2 handler dispatch.

## 5. Soft-Delete

When `FileHandler.Handle()` returns `ActionSoftDelete` on `unlinkat`:

1. **Deny** the original `unlinkat` (nr = -1, fake success with return value 0)
2. **Inject** `renameat2(dirfd, path, trashDirFD, trashPath, 0)` to move the file to trash
3. **Inject** `mkdirat` for the trash directory on first use if it doesn't exist
4. **Emit** audit event with trash path for operator recovery

**Limitations:**
- Cross-device rename fails - fall back to deny with audit log
- Trash directory must be on the same filesystem as the file being deleted

From the tracee's perspective, `unlink()` returns 0 (success). The file is moved to trash instead of deleted. Identical to FUSE soft-delete behavior.

## 6. Connect Redirect

When `NetworkHandler.Handle()` returns `ActionRedirect`:

1. Read `sockaddr` from tracee memory, parse family/address/port
2. Resolve redirect target hostname to IP in the tracer process
3. Encode new `sockaddr_in` (16 bytes) or `sockaddr_in6` (28 bytes)
4. Write back at the same pointer - always fits (fixed-size structs)
5. Resume - kernel connects to the redirect target

**IPv4 ↔ IPv6 mismatch:** Prefer resolving to matching address family. If original is IPv4 and redirect is IPv6-only, update `addrlen` register and use stack-relative scratch for the 12 extra bytes. Prefer `.To4()` results when available.

## 7. Handler Interface Changes

Extend result types to support steering actions:

```go
type ExecResult struct {
    Action    Action  // Allow | Deny | Redirect
    Errno     int32
    StubPath  string  // for Redirect
    // StubFD managed internally by tracer
}

type FileResult struct {
    Action       Action  // Allow | Deny | Redirect | SoftDelete
    Errno        int32
    RedirectPath string  // for Redirect
    TrashDir     string  // for SoftDelete
}

type NetworkResult struct {
    Action       Action  // Allow | Deny | Redirect
    Errno        int32
    RedirectAddr net.IP  // for Redirect
    RedirectPort int     // for Redirect
}
```

Syscall handler dispatch adds a third path:

```
handler.Handle() → result
  Allow      → allowSyscall(tid)
  Deny       → denySyscall(tid, errno)
  Redirect   → redirectExec/redirectFile/redirectConnect(tid, result)
  SoftDelete → softDelete(tid, result)
```

All redirect operations save registers upfront and restore + deny on any injection failure.

## 8. Testing Strategy

Integration tests behind `//go:build integration && linux`, using helper binaries compiled at test time.

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `TestIntegration_SyscallInjection` | Inject `getpid()`, verify return matches tracee's PID |
| `TestIntegration_ExecRedirect` | Redirect `/bin/echo` → stub, verify stub runs |
| `TestIntegration_FileRedirect` | Redirect `openat` path, verify redirected file contents read |
| `TestIntegration_SoftDelete` | Soft-delete on `unlinkat`, verify file at trash path, helper saw success |
| `TestIntegration_ConnectRedirect` | Redirect connect to different port, verify connection to redirect target |
| `TestIntegration_ScratchPage` | Redirect to longer path, verify mmap injection + redirect works |

All runnable via `docker run --cap-add SYS_PTRACE`.

## 11. Implementation Notes (2026-03-13)

Key design refinements discovered during implementation:

### Injection engine

- **Dual-mode injection**: `injectSyscall` auto-selects between single-phase
  (from entry stop, hijacks ORIG_RAX) and two-phase (from exit, uses gadget)
  based on `state.InSyscall`. Callers don't need to know the stop state.
- **waitForSyscallStop**: Uses WNOHANG|WALL polling with 5s deadline (not
  blocking Wait4). Handles PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP as a syscall-entry-equivalent
  stop. Only counts actual stop events toward the 100-event guard, not empty
  polls.
- **TRACESYSGOOD vs prefilter**: Plain SIGTRAP is a syscall stop only in
  prefilter mode (no TRACESYSGOOD). In TRACESYSGOOD mode, plain SIGTRAP is
  a real ptrace event signal. `traceSysGood()` method gates the check.

### Exec redirect

- **FD displacement protection**: `injectFDIntoTracee` checks if fd 100 is
  already open via `fcntl(F_GETFD)` and saves it with `F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC`
  (CLOEXEC ensures the saved copy auto-closes on successful exec, preventing
  fd leaks into the stub). `cleanupInjectedFD` restores on failure.
- **arm64 arg0 clobber**: `SetReturnValue` writes x0 (which is also arg0 on
  arm64). The filename pointer must be saved before `SetReturnValue` and
  restored afterward for the non-execveat case.
- **In-place write fallback**: Tries overwriting the original filename buffer
  first. On failure (e.g., read-only mapping), falls back to scratch page.
- **execveat normalization**: Always converts to SYS_EXECVE with the stub
  path, avoiding AT_EMPTY_PATH and non-AT_FDCWD edge cases.
- **PendingExecStubFD/PendingExecSavedFD**: TraceeState fields for tracking
  injected stub fd across the exec boundary. Cleaned up on exec failure in
  `handleSyscallStop`, cleared on exec success in `handleExecEvent`.

### File redirect and soft-delete

- **advancePastEntry**: Both `redirectFile` and `softDeleteFile` advance past
  the original entry (nullify ORIG_RAX, PtraceSyscall to EXIT, restore regs)
  before doing helper injections. This ensures all injections use the
  two-phase gadget protocol from EXIT state.
- **Legacy syscall support**: amd64 has legacy SYS_OPEN, SYS_UNLINK, etc.
  `filePathArgIndex` delegates to arch-specific `legacyFilePathArgIndex` for
  unknown syscalls. `softDeleteFile` accepts `isLegacyUnlink(nr)`.

### Connect redirect

- **In-place sockaddr overwrite**: IPv4 sockaddr is 16 bytes, IPv6 is 28
  bytes - both fixed-size, always fit in the original buffer. No scratch
  page needed.

### Error recovery

- **resumeWithErrno**: Sets RAX=-errno and calls `allowSyscall` from EXIT
  state. All redirect functions use this for error recovery after
  `advancePastEntry`.
- **hasPendingSyscallExit**: Routes plain SIGTRAP to `handleSyscallStop` in
  prefilter mode. Includes `PendingExecStubFD >= 0` to ensure failed execs
  get cleanup routed correctly.
