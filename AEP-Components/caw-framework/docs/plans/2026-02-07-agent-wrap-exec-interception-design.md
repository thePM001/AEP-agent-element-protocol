# Agent Wrap: Exec Interception for AI Agents on Developer Machines

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Status**: Design

## Problem

AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Amp, Cursor, Antigravity) spawn shell commands via `/bin/bash -c "..."` or similar. On developer machines - unlike containers - we cannot replace `/bin/bash` with a shim because that would break the underlying OS.

We need a mechanism to intercept every `execve()` / `CreateProcess()` from a supervised agent and its descendants, routing each call through the full aep-caw exec pipeline (policy check, approval workflow, audit logging, output capture) without modifying system binaries.

## Requirements

- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Does not modify system binaries (`/bin/bash`, `/bin/sh`, etc.)
- Does not break the underlying OS - interception is scoped to the agent process tree only
- Routes through the **full aep-caw exec pipeline**, not just allow/deny
- Supports all decision types: allow, deny, approve, redirect
- Minimal overhead for allowed commands (the common case)
- Not blocked by enterprise EDR tools
- Supports both CLI agents and GUI IDEs (Cursor)

## Architecture

```

### Interception Flow

```
Agent spawns: bash -c "npm install"
       │
       ▼
OS interceptor catches execve
       │
       ▼
POST /sessions/{sid}/exec
  body: {command: "bash", args: ["-c", "npm install"]}
       │
       ▼
Policy engine evaluates command rules
       │
       ├── allow   → execute, audit, return result
       ├── deny    → fail execve with EPERM, audit
       ├── approve → hold, send approval request, wait
       └── redirect → rewrite command, execute, audit
       │
       ▼
Result (exit code, stdout, stderr) proxied back to agent
```

### Recursion Guard

When aep-caw itself spawns the allowed command, that child exec must NOT be re-intercepted:

- **Linux**: The aep-caw server process runs **outside** the seccomp-filtered process tree (it is the supervisor, never a child of the wrapped agent). It maintains a kernel-side taint list via the seccomp notify fd - only PIDs descended from the agent root are in the filtered tree. Children spawned by the server are never subject to the filter because they inherit the server's (unfiltered) seccomp state, not the agent's.
- **macOS**: `es_mute_process()` on any process spawned by the aep-caw server. Muted processes and all descendants are invisible to the ES client.
- **Windows**: Driver maintains a "muted PIDs" set. Processes spawned by `aep-caw-svc.exe` are added to it and excluded from interception.

## Linux Implementation: seccomp user-notify

Extends the existing `aep-caw-unixwrap` from allow/deny to full pipeline routing.

### Current Flow (today)

1. Install seccomp filter with `SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF` on `execve`/`execveat`
2. Supervisor goroutine receives notifications
3. Policy check → allow or deny the syscall
4. If allowed, `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_SEND` continues the syscall in-place

### New Flow (full pipeline routing)

1. Same seccomp filter installation
2. Supervisor receives execve notification
3. Read target binary path and argv from `/proc/<pid>/mem` (requires `PTRACE_MODE_READ` - the supervisor must be the direct parent or `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` must be held; `process_vm_readv` is an alternative that works under Yama ptrace_scope=1 when the supervisor is the parent)
4. Send to aep-caw server API (`POST /sessions/{sid}/exec`)
5. Server runs full pipeline: policy → approval → audit → execute
6. **If allowed (common case)**: `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_SEND` continues the syscall in-place. Zero overhead.
7. **If routed through pipeline (approve/redirect)**: Use `SECCOMP_ADDFD_FLAG_SEND` to inject an `aep-caw-stub` binary fd, then respond with `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_SEND` to continue the execve - but redirected to execute the stub instead of the original target. The stub inherits the original process's pid/ppid relationships and file descriptors, connects to the aep-caw server over a pre-injected Unix socket fd, and proxies stdin/stdout/stderr from the server-spawned command. The stub exits with the proxied exit code, so `waitpid()` in the parent works correctly.
8. **If denied**: Fail the syscall with `EPERM`.

> **Design note**: We do NOT fail the execve and attempt to replace fds post-failure. A failed execve returns control to the calling process (typically a shell `exec` path), which does not expect to continue. Instead, we redirect the execve to a cooperative stub that preserves normal process lifecycle semantics.

### Taint Tracking

The existing `ProcessTaint` system tracks process ancestry. All children of the wrapped agent are tainted and subject to interception. Processes outside the tree are untouched.

### EDR Risk: LOW

seccomp is a defensive kernel mechanism used by Docker, Flatpak, Chrome sandbox, and systemd. EDR tools recognize it as a legitimate security tool.

## macOS Implementation: Endpoint Security AUTH_EXEC

New binary `aep-caw-macwrap-es` using Apple's Endpoint Security framework.

### Architecture

- `aep-caw-macwrap-es` is a privileged daemon that registers as an ES client
- Subscribes to `ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_EXEC` events
- Runs as root (required by ES framework)
- Communicates with the user-space aep-caw server over local API

### Flow

1. `aep-caw wrap -- claude-code` launches the agent as a child process
2. `aep-caw-macwrap-es` records the agent's PID as the taint root
3. When any descendant calls execve, ES delivers an `AUTH_EXEC` event
4. Handler checks if the process is in the tainted tree (via `es_process_t.ppid` chain or aep-caw taint cache)
5. If tainted: extract target binary path and argv from `es_event_exec_arg_get()`
6. Send to aep-caw server API (`POST /sessions/{sid}/exec`)
7. Based on pipeline result:
   - **Allow**: `ES_AUTH_RESULT_ALLOW` - process runs natively, event is audited
   - **Deny**: `ES_AUTH_RESULT_DENY` - process gets `EPERM`
   - **Redirect/Approve**: `ES_AUTH_RESULT_DENY` the original exec. The aep-caw server then spawns `aep-caw-stub` as a new child of the original parent process (using `posix_spawn` with the parent's context). The stub connects to the aep-caw server via Unix socket, receives proxied stdout/stderr, and exits with the proxied exit code. The parent sees a failed exec followed by a successful stub child - agents handle this gracefully as they retry or read from the next child.

> **Design note**: ES `AUTH_EXEC` does not support rewriting the target binary or argv of a pending exec. We cannot "replace" the binary mid-exec. The deny-then-respawn pattern is the correct approach for the ES framework.

### Recursion Guard

`es_mute_process()` on any process spawned by the aep-caw server. Muted processes and all descendants are invisible to the ES client - no events, no overhead.

### Entitlements and Distribution

- Requires `com.apple.developer.endpoint-security.client` entitlement
- Must be signed and notarized
- Delivered as a System Extension (`.systemextension` inside app bundle)
- Installed via `OSSystemExtensionRequest`
- User grants permission once in System Settings > Privacy & Security
- Same distribution pattern as CrowdStrike Falcon and other macOS EDR tools

### EDR Risk: LOW

The ES framework IS the mechanism that EDR tools use. An ES client is never flagged by other EDRs - it's the blessed Apple approach.

## Windows Implementation: Kernel Driver + Userspace Service

### Components

- **`aep-caw-drv.sys`** - Kernel driver (C only, ~1500 lines). Registers process creation callbacks, maintains taint table, communicates with userspace via filter port.
- **`aep-caw-svc.exe`** - Windows service (Go). Communicates with the driver via IOCTL, routes intercepted execs through the aep-caw server API, spawns allowed processes.
- **`aep-caw-stub.exe`** - I/O proxy stub (Go). Lightweight binary that proxies stdin/stdout/stderr from the aep-caw-spawned command back to the original parent.

### Kernel Driver Flow

1. Register `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx` callback
2. Callback fires on every `NtCreateUserProcess` system-wide
3. Check if parent PID is in the tainted process tree (kernel-side hash table)
4. If not tainted: return immediately - zero overhead for unrelated processes
5. If tainted:
   - Allow process creation to proceed (do NOT block with `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`)
   - Immediately suspend the new process via `PsSuspendProcess`
   - Queue message to userspace via `FltSendMessage` (filter communication port)
   - Message contains: new process PID, parent PID, target image path, command line, environment
6. Userspace decides:
   - **Allow**: Resume the suspended process via IOCTL (`PsResumeProcess`). Zero additional overhead.
   - **Deny**: Terminate the suspended process via `ZwTerminateProcess(STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED)`. Parent receives the expected error.
   - **Redirect**: Terminate the suspended process, spawn `aep-caw-stub.exe` as a child of the original parent (via `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS`). Stub proxies I/O from the server-spawned command.

> **Design note**: The suspend-then-decide pattern preserves a valid process handle for the parent. Unlike blocking `CreateProcess` with `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED` (which prevents the parent from receiving any handle), suspending allows the parent's `CreateProcess` call to succeed, giving it a valid handle to wait on.

### Userspace Service Flow

1. `aep-caw-svc.exe` receives suspended-process notification via filter port
2. Sends to aep-caw server API (`POST /sessions/{sid}/exec`)
3. Pipeline runs: policy → approval → audit → execute
4. If allowed: resumes the suspended process via driver IOCTL, proxies I/O back
5. If denied: terminates the suspended process, returns denial status to parent
6. If redirected: terminates the suspended process, spawns `aep-caw-stub.exe` as child of original parent with `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS`, proxies I/O from the actual command

### Taint Tree Management

- `aep-caw wrap -- claude-code.exe` registers agent PID with driver via IOCTL
- Driver adds PID to taint table
- On process creation: if parent is tainted, child is automatically tainted
- On process exit (`PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine`): PID removed from taint table

### Signing Roadmap

| Phase | Signing | EDR Status |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Phase 1 | EV code-signed | Requires EDR whitelisting |
| Phase 2 | WHQL-certified via Microsoft Hardware Dev Center | Trusted by all EDRs |

### EDR Whitelisting Documentation

Ship documentation for whitelisting `aep-caw-drv.sys` in:
- CrowdStrike Falcon (IOA exclusion)
- SentinelOne (process exclusion)
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (ASR exclusion)
- Palo Alto Cortex XDR (behavioral exception)

### Installation

Delivered as a driver package (`.inf` + `.sys` + `.cat`), installed via `PnPUtil` or custom installer. Service registered as standard Windows service.

## I/O Proxying and Stub Process

When an intercepted exec is routed through the pipeline (not just allowed in-place), the calling process expects a child that produces output and exits with a code.

### The Problem

An AI agent calls `subprocess.Popen(["bash", "-c", "ls -la"])`. The OS intercepts the execve, blocks it, and aep-caw runs the command instead. But the agent is waiting on a child process with stdin/stdout/stderr pipes and an exit code.

### Solution: Per-OS Stub Pattern

**Linux (seccomp)**:
The seccomp supervisor intercepts the execve via `SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF`. For redirect/approve decisions, it uses `SECCOMP_ADDFD_FLAG_SEND` to inject a Unix socket fd into the target process, then responds to the notification by redirecting the execve to `aep-caw-stub`. The stub:
- Connects to the aep-caw server over the injected Unix socket
- Receives proxied stdout/stderr from the actual command running under the aep-caw pipeline
- Exits with the proxied exit code

The parent sees a child that exec'd, produced output, and exited - normal process lifecycle.

**macOS (ES)**:
The ES handler denies the original exec (`ES_AUTH_RESULT_DENY`). The aep-caw server then spawns `aep-caw-stub` as a new child process. The stub:
- Connects to the aep-caw server via Unix socket
- Receives proxied stdout/stderr from the actual command
- Exits with the proxied exit code

The parent sees a failed exec but the agent framework retries or the wrapping shell handles the failure. For agents that use `fork+exec` patterns, the stub is spawned by the server as a sibling process.

> **Note**: ES `AUTH_EXEC` does not support rewriting exec targets. The deny-then-respawn pattern is the only viable approach.

**Windows**:
The driver suspends the newly created process. For redirect decisions, the service terminates the suspended process and spawns `aep-caw-stub.exe` as the "child" of the original parent (using `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS`), which proxies I/O from the actual command running under the aep-caw pipeline. For allow decisions, the suspended process is simply resumed.

### Common Case Optimization

Most intercepted commands are **allowed** (audit-only). In that case:
- Linux: syscall continues normally, zero proxy overhead
- macOS: `ES_AUTH_RESULT_ALLOW`, process runs natively
- Windows: driver doesn't block, process creates normally

The proxy path only activates for redirected or approval-required commands.

## Agent Launch Examples

### CLI Command

`aep-caw wrap` is the single user-facing command across all OSes:

```bash
# CLI agents (identical on all OSes)
aep-caw wrap -- claude-code
aep-caw wrap -- codex
aep-caw wrap -- opencode
aep-caw wrap -- amp
aep-caw wrap -- antigravity

# Cursor IDE
aep-caw wrap -- cursor                                              # Linux
aep-caw wrap -- open -a Cursor                                      # macOS
aep-caw wrap -- "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Cursor\Cursor.exe"  # Windows

# With explicit session and policy
aep-caw wrap --session my-dev --policy strict -- claude-code
aep-caw wrap --session pr-review --policy read-only -- cursor

# With auto-created session
aep-caw wrap --root /home/dev/myproject --policy default -- claude-code
```

### What `aep-caw wrap` Does

1. Creates or reuses a session
2. Starts the OS-specific interceptor (unixwrap / macwrap-es / drv+svc)
3. Registers the agent PID as taint root
4. Launches the agent process
5. On exit: generates a session report, cleans up

## Default Policies

### `agent-default.yaml`

Ships with aep-caw. Applied when no `--policy` is specified.

```yaml

    destinations: ["github.com", "*.githubusercontent.com"]
    decision: allow

  # Everything else - require approval
  - name: other-network
    destinations: ["*"]
    decision: approve
```

### `agent-strict.yaml`

For high-security environments:
- All commands require approval except read-only operations
- Network access blocked by default
- File writes only within workspace

### `agent-observe.yaml`

Audit-only mode for initial profiling:
- Everything allowed, everything logged
- Use with `aep-caw policy generate` to create a custom policy from observed behavior (profile-then-lock workflow)
