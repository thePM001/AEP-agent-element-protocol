# Ptrace Phase 4b: DNS Redirect, SNI Rewrite, TracerPid Masking - Design

**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Author:** Eran / Canyon Road
**Status:** Implemented

---

## Overview

Phase 4b adds three features to the ptrace backend, all building on Phase 4a's syscall injection engine:

1. **DNS Redirect** - An in-process DNS proxy intercepts and steers DNS queries per policy
2. **SNI Rewrite** - In-place ClientHello rewrite on TLS-watched sockets
3. **TracerPid Masking** - Hide ptrace relationship by patching `/proc/*/status` reads

## 1. DNS Redirect

### Architecture

An in-process DNS proxy runs as a goroutine in the tracer process. It binds to both `127.0.0.1:0` and `[::1]:0` (OS-assigned ports) on UDP and TCP. The assigned ports are stored on the `Tracer` struct. IPv4 tracee traffic is redirected to the IPv4 listener, IPv6 to the IPv6 listener - preserving socket family semantics.

DNS traffic reaches the proxy via two interception paths:

1. **Connected sockets** (`connect` to port 53): The existing connect redirect from Phase 4a rewrites the sockaddr to `127.0.0.1:<proxyPort>` (AF_INET) or `[::1]:<proxyPort>` (AF_INET6). Subsequent `send`/`write` goes to the proxy naturally.

2. **Unconnected sockets** (`sendto`/`sendmsg` to port 53): Many DNS implementations (musl libc, custom resolvers) use `sendto` with a destination address without calling `connect` first. The tracer intercepts `sendto`/`sendmsg` on syscall-enter, parses the destination sockaddr from arg4/arg5, and if the destination port is 53, rewrites the destination address in tracee memory to the proxy's address. The original resolver address is saved for forwarding.

**DoT (port 853) is NOT redirected** to the DNS proxy. DoT wraps DNS in TLS - the plain proxy cannot process TLS-wrapped queries. DoT interception would require TLS termination, which is out of scope. Port 853 is only used for SNI fd-watching (Section 2).

### Connect Redirect Integration

In `handleNetwork()`, after `parseSockaddr()`, if the destination port is 53 and family is AF_INET or AF_INET6, redirect:
- AF_INET → rewrite sockaddr to `127.0.0.1:<proxyPort>` (16-byte `sockaddr_in`)
- AF_INET6 → rewrite sockaddr to `[::1]:<proxyPort>` (28-byte `sockaddr_in6`), update `addrlen` register

### Sendto/Sendmsg Redirect Integration

In `handleWrite()` (or a dedicated `handleSendto()`), on syscall-enter for `SYS_SENDTO`:
1. Check arg4 (dest_addr pointer) - if NULL, this is a connected-mode send, skip
2. Read and parse the destination sockaddr
3. If port is 53: save original resolver, rewrite dest_addr to proxy address (matching family), allow syscall
4. If port is not 53: fall through to TLS fd-watch check (SNI rewrite)

For `SYS_SENDMSG`, the destination is in the `msghdr.msg_name` field. Read the `msghdr` struct from tracee memory, extract `msg_name` pointer and `msg_namelen`, then apply the same logic.

### Query Processing Flow

```
Tracee DNS query (via connect-redirect or sendto-redirect) → proxy receives query
  1. Parse DNS question (domain, type)
  2. Look up tracee info from TGID+fd key (tracked on redirect)
  3. Call NetworkHandler.HandleNetwork() with:
     - Operation: "dns"
     - Domain: query name
     - Address: original resolver IP
     - Port: 53
     - PID/SessionID from tracked connection
  4. Based on NetworkResult:
     - Allow            → forward to original resolver, relay response
     - Deny             → respond with NXDOMAIN (RCODE 3)
     - RedirectUpstream → forward to result.RedirectUpstream resolver
     - SyntheticRecords → build response with result.Records
  5. Return DNS response to tracee
```

### PID Tracking

The proxy needs to know which tracee PID owns each connection. The tracer records `{TGID, fd} → {PID, sessionID, originalResolver}` at redirect time - using TGID+fd as the key (not source port, which is collision-prone under port reuse). The proxy resolves the connection back to this mapping via the fd tracker.

### Proxy Lifecycle

Starts when the tracer starts (if `TraceNetwork` is enabled). Stops when the tracer shuts down. No external dependencies.

## 2. SNI Rewrite

### Fd Tracking

When a `connect` syscall completes successfully (syscall-exit, return value 0) and the destination port is 443 or 853, the tracer looks up the destination IP in the DNS resolution cache (`domainForIP`). If a non-empty domain is found, the fd is added to a per-TGID `tlsWatchedFds` set with that domain. If no domain is known (IP was hardcoded, or DNS resolution happened before attach), the fd is **not** watched - this avoids rewriting SNI to an empty string.

Cleared on `close(fd)`, `dup2` over the fd, and `exec` (fd table reset).

### Write Interception

`SYS_WRITE` is added to syscall dispatch for SNI rewrite. `SYS_SENDTO` is already in `isNetworkSyscall` and checked for TLS fd watching there. On syscall-enter, check if the fd (arg0) is in `tlsWatchedFds`. If not, allow immediately - near-zero overhead for non-TLS writes.

`SYS_SENDMSG` is **not** handled for SNI rewrite - its arg layout differs (`arg1=msghdr*`, `arg2=flags`) and TLS writes over sendmsg are rare in practice. If needed later, dedicated msghdr/iovec parsing can be added.

If the fd is watched:

1. Read the first 5 bytes from the write buffer (TLS record header)
2. Check: content type 0x16 (handshake), version 0x0301-0x0303, then record length
3. Read byte 6: handshake type 0x01 (ClientHello)
4. Parse to find SNI extension (type 0x0000) within extensions list
5. If no SNI or SNI matches policy target → allow, remove fd from watch set
6. If SNI needs rewriting → rewrite in tracee memory

### Rewrite Mechanics

- **Any length change (shorter or longer):** build a new compacted buffer with the replacement SNI and all length fields updated (TLS record, handshake, extensions, SNI extension, server name list, host name). If the new buffer fits in the original write length, overwrite in-place. If longer, allocate from scratch page, write the new buffer there, and update the buffer pointer register (arg1) and length register (arg2).
- **Same length:** overwrite the SNI bytes in-place. No length fixup needed.
- After rewrite, remove fd from watch set (SNI only appears in the first ClientHello)

### TLS Record Length Fixup

If the SNI length changes, three length fields need updating in the buffer:

1. TLS record length (bytes 3-4)
2. Handshake length (bytes 6-8)
3. SNI extension length + server name list length + name length

All are at known offsets once parsed. The tracer writes the corrected lengths back to tracee memory.

### Edge Cases

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Partial write (buffer split across syscalls) | Only inspect first write per fd; if header incomplete, remove from watch and allow |
| TLS 1.3 with encrypted ClientHello (ECH) | SNI not visible - allow, can't rewrite |
| Non-TLS traffic on port 443 (HTTP, WebSocket upgrade) | First bytes won't match TLS record header - allow |
| `sendmsg` with scatter/gather iovec | Not handled for SNI rewrite - different arg layout (`msghdr*`, not buf+len) |

## 3. TracerPid Masking

### Openat Tracking

In the existing `handleFile()` path, after path resolution, check if the resolved path matches `/proc/<N>/status` or `/proc/self/status` or `/proc/thread-self/status`. If so, allow the open but record the returned fd on syscall-exit: add to a per-TGID `maskedStatusFds` map keyed by fd number.

No handler call needed - unconditional stealth behavior when `TracerConfig.MaskTracerPid` is true.

### Read Interception

`SYS_READ` and `SYS_PREAD64` are added to syscall dispatch. On syscall-exit (after the kernel has written data to the buffer):

1. Check if the fd is in `maskedStatusFds` - if not, skip immediately
2. Read the buffer from tracee memory (up to return value bytes)
3. Scan for `TracerPid:\t` (bytes: `54 72 61 63 65 72 50 69 64 3a 09`)
4. If found, overwrite the PID number with `0` followed by spaces to fill the original width (preserving newline position)
5. Write patched buffer back to tracee memory

### Fd Lifecycle

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `openat` returns fd for `/proc/*/status` | Add fd to `maskedStatusFds` |
| `close(fd)` where fd is tracked | Remove from `maskedStatusFds` |
| `dup2(old, new)` where new is tracked | Remove new (overwritten) |
| `exec` | Clear all tracked fds for the TGID |

### Performance

The `read` syscall is extremely hot. The fd check is a map lookup on syscall-exit, which is cheap. The actual buffer scan only happens for reads on tracked fds (only `/proc/*/status` files), which is rare.

### What This Doesn't Cover

- `/proc/<pid>/stat` - TracerPid is not in this file
- `PTRACE_TRACEME` detection via `ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME)` returning `EPERM`
- `PR_SET_PTRACER` / prctl-based detection

## 4. Handler Interface Changes

### NetworkContext Additions

```go
type NetworkContext struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    Domain    string // DNS query name (set when Operation == "dns")
    QueryType uint16 // DNS query type: A=1, AAAA=28, CNAME=5, etc.
}
```

### NetworkResult Additions

```go
type NetworkResult struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    RedirectUpstream string      // Forward DNS query to this resolver (ip:port)
    Records          []DNSRecord // Synthetic DNS response records
}

type DNSRecord struct {
    Type  uint16 // A, AAAA, CNAME
    Value string // IP address or domain name
    TTL   uint32
}
```

When `Operation == "dns"`:
- `Allow` → forward to original resolver
- `Deny` → return NXDOMAIN
- `Action == Redirect` + `RedirectUpstream` set → forward to different resolver
- `Action == Redirect` + `Records` set → return synthetic response

When `Operation == "connect"` - unchanged from Phase 4a.

### TracerConfig Addition

```go
type TracerConfig struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    MaskTracerPid bool // Enable TracerPid masking on /proc/*/status reads
}
```

## 5. Syscall Dispatch Changes

### New Classifications

```
isWriteSyscall(nr):  SYS_WRITE
isReadSyscall(nr):   SYS_READ, SYS_PREAD64
isCloseSyscall(nr):  SYS_CLOSE
```

Note: `SYS_SENDTO` remains in `isNetworkSyscall` - the handler checks for both DNS redirect (destination port 53) and TLS fd watching (SNI rewrite). `SYS_SENDMSG` is not intercepted for SNI rewrite due to incompatible arg layout.

### Updated Dispatch

```
dispatchSyscall(tid, nr):
  isExecveSyscall   → handleExecve()
  isFileSyscall     → handleFile()
  isNetworkSyscall  → handleNetwork()    // connect, bind - unchanged
  isSignalSyscall   → handleSignal()
  isWriteSyscall    → handleWrite()      // NEW: SNI rewrite
  isReadSyscall     → handleRead()       // NEW: TracerPid masking (exit only)
  isCloseSyscall    → handleClose()      // NEW: fd tracking cleanup
  else              → allowSyscall()
```

### Fast-Path Guards

- `handleWrite()`: check `tlsWatchedFds[fd]` → miss? `allowSyscall()` immediately
- `handleRead()`: only acts on syscall-exit; check `maskedStatusFds[fd]` → miss? skip
- `handleClose()`: check if fd is in either tracking map → miss? `allowSyscall()` immediately

### Syscall-Exit Handling

Phase 4b adds two exit-time behaviors:

1. **Read masking**: on exit, if fd tracked → scan and patch buffer
2. **Openat fd capture**: on exit, if path was `/proc/*/status` → record returned fd

Both need the exit return value from registers.

## 6. Testing Strategy

Integration tests behind `//go:build integration && linux`, following the existing pattern.

### DNS Redirect Tests

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `TestIntegration_DNSProxyAllow` | Tracee resolves domain, proxy forwards to real resolver, valid response |
| `TestIntegration_DNSProxyDeny` | Handler returns deny, tracee gets NXDOMAIN |
| `TestIntegration_DNSProxyRedirectUpstream` | Handler returns redirect, query forwarded to alternate resolver |
| `TestIntegration_DNSProxySyntheticRecords` | Handler returns synthetic A/AAAA records, tracee gets those IPs |
| `TestIntegration_DNSConnectRedirect` | Tracee's connect to `8.8.8.8:53` transparently redirected to proxy |
| `TestIntegration_DNSSendtoRedirect` | Tracee uses unconnected sendto to `8.8.8.8:53`, query intercepted by proxy |
| `TestIntegration_DNSIPv6Redirect` | Tracee connects to `[2001:4860:4860::8888]:53`, redirected to `[::1]:<proxyPort>` |

### SNI Rewrite Tests

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `TestIntegration_SNIRewriteSameLength` | SNI rewritten to same-length name, TLS handshake succeeds |
| `TestIntegration_SNIRewriteShorter` | SNI rewritten to shorter name, length fields updated correctly |
| `TestIntegration_SNIRewriteLonger` | SNI rewritten to longer name via scratch page, length fields correct |
| `TestIntegration_SNINoRewrite` | Non-matching SNI passes through unchanged |
| `TestIntegration_SNINonTLSPort443` | HTTP on port 443 - no crash, allowed through |

### TracerPid Masking Tests

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `TestIntegration_TracerPidMasked` | Tracee reads `/proc/self/status`, sees `TracerPid: 0` |
| `TestIntegration_TracerPidMaskedByPid` | Tracee reads `/proc/<own-pid>/status`, sees `TracerPid: 0` |
| `TestIntegration_TracerPidDisabled` | `MaskTracerPid: false`, tracee sees real TracerPid |
| `TestIntegration_TracerPidFdClose` | After close+reopen of unrelated file with same fd, no false masking |

All runnable via `docker run --cap-add SYS_PTRACE`.

## 8. What's NOT in Phase 4b

- DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) interception - would require HTTPS MITM
- DoT (DNS-over-TLS, port 853) interception - would require TLS termination in the proxy
- Full TLS proxy / certificate management
- `PTRACE_TRACEME` detection masking
- Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) rewrite - not feasible without TLS proxy
- Multi-resolver chaining (single upstream per redirect)

## 9. Known Limitations

- **Unconnected UDP DNS response source address**: When `sendto` DNS traffic is redirected, `recvfrom` returns the proxy's address (127.0.0.1/::1) as the source instead of the original resolver. DNS clients that validate response source address may reject the reply. In practice, glibc uses connected sockets and musl doesn't validate source, so this is unlikely to cause issues. If needed, a `recvfrom` exit-time source address rewrite can be added later.
- **Single resolver per fd for unconnected UDP DNS**: The `{TGID, fd}` key stores one `originalResolver` per socket. If a process sends to multiple resolvers on the same unconnected socket concurrently, the mapping may be stale. In practice DNS clients use one resolver per socket.
- **SYS_SENDMSG not handled for SNI rewrite**: The `sendmsg` syscall has a different argument layout (`arg1=msghdr*`, `arg2=flags`) than `write`/`sendto`. TLS writes via `sendmsg` are rare; dedicated msghdr/iovec parsing can be added if needed.
- **TLS watch requires prior DNS resolution**: Connections to hardcoded IPs (no DNS lookup) or IPs resolved before tracer attachment will not have domain→IP mappings, so TLS fd watching and SNI rewrite will not activate for those connections.
