# arm64 SIGURG preemption reproducer

Manual regression test for the Go SIGURG / seccomp user-notify interaction
fixed in PR #225 and hardened in the libseccomp 2.6 defense-in-depth
change. Run this before cutting any release that touches `internal/netmonitor/unix/`
or `cmd/aep-caw-unixwrap/`.

## What this verifies

- Layer 1 (`SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_WAIT_KILLABLE_RECV`, kernel ≥6.0) is actually
  engaged on arm64 - not just compiled in.
- Under Go async preemption (~10ms SIGURG cadence), seccomp notifications
  are not interrupted by ERESTARTSYS loops.

## Environment

- arm64 Linux VM (bare-metal or qemu-system-aarch64).
- Kernel ≥6.0 (`uname -r` to confirm).
- aep-caw binaries built by the release workflow (deb or tar.gz for arm64).

A suitable test host is a stock Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 cloud instance - the
Docker test matrix does not exercise this case because GitHub does not
offer an arm64 runner with FUSE and seccomp user-notify permissions in the
same image.

## Procedure

1. Install the release deb:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i aep-caw_<version>_linux_arm64.deb
   ```

2. Install the shell shim:

   ```bash
   sudo aep-caw shim install-shell \
     --root / \
     --shim /usr/bin/aep-caw-shell-shim \
     --bash \
     --i-understand-this-modifies-the-host
   ```

3. Start a server with seccomp execve enabled, capturing stderr to a
   file so we can inspect it for warnings:

   ```bash
   sudo aep-caw server --config /etc/aep-caw/config.yaml \
     >/tmp/aep-caw-server.log 2>&1 &
   ```

   (The server is backgrounded from an interactive shell here, not
   managed by systemd, so `journalctl` will not see it - the captured
   log file is the source of truth.)

4. Create a session and run a Go workload that stresses preemption.
   The packaged `aep-caw` binary is itself a Go program with async
   preemption enabled, so invoking it inside the sandbox exercises the
   same SIGURG + seccomp-notify interaction as the PR #225 repro. No
   Go toolchain or source checkout is needed:

   ```bash
   sid=$(aep-caw session create --workspace /tmp --json | jq -r .id)
   aep-caw exec "$sid" -- aep-caw --help >/dev/null
   ```

   Expected: completes in well under 10 seconds with exit code 0.

5. Repeat the same stressed invocation in a tight loop for 100
   iterations - this is the release gate, so the loop must run a
   longer-lived Go-binary workload with several trap points per call,
   not `aep-caw --help` (which can finish before Go's ~10 ms
   async-preemption SIGURG fires). `session list` opens an HTTP
   connection to the server, which keeps the wrapped Go runtime alive
   across several seccomp-trapped syscalls - `connect`, `sendto`,
   `recvfrom` - each of which can land inside a ~10 ms
   async-preemption window, so 100 iterations gives many real chances
   to catch a Layer 1 regression:

   ```bash
   wrapper_log=$(mktemp /tmp/aep-caw-unixwrap-stderr.XXXXXX)
   for i in $(seq 1 100); do
     aep-caw exec "$sid" -- aep-caw session list >/dev/null 2>>"$wrapper_log" \
       || { echo "FAIL iter $i"; exit 1; }
   done
   echo "PASS: 100 iterations (wrapper stderr captured to ${wrapper_log})"
   ```

   Expected: 100 PASS. A hang or high failure rate indicates Layer 1
   is not engaged and Layer 2 alone is insufficient.

   The `2>>"$wrapper_log"` redirect is load-bearing: the
   `WaitKillable` fallback WARN is emitted by
   `aep-caw-unixwrap` (the wrapper installs the seccomp filter), not
   by the long-lived `aep-caw server`. The server relays that stderr
   through the exec response to the `aep-caw exec` CLI's stderr, where
   this redirect captures it. The server log alone never sees these
   warnings, so step 6 below must grep both files.

6. Confirm Layer 1 actually engaged. The fallback paths (both
   `SetWaitKill` failure and filter-load rejection) log a WARN line
   containing `WaitKillable`; its absence is the success signal. Check
   both the captured server log and the wrapper-stderr log captured
   in step 5:

   ```bash
   if grep -q "WaitKillable" /tmp/aep-caw-server.log "$wrapper_log" 2>/dev/null; then
     echo "FAIL: Layer 1 fell back to SIGURG signal mask (Layer 2) only" >&2
     grep -H "WaitKillable" /tmp/aep-caw-server.log "$wrapper_log" >&2 || true
     exit 1
   fi
   echo "PASS: no Layer 1 fallback warnings (checked server log + wrapper stderr)"
   ```

   Expected: `PASS: no Layer 1 fallback warnings`. If step 5 PASSed but
   this step FAILs, Layer 2 was silently masking a Layer 1 regression.

## Recording results

Paste the output of `uname -a`, `dpkg -l libseccomp2 | tail -1` (on the
host - note we do not depend on this but it's useful context), the
PASS line from step 5, and the PASS line from step 6 into the release
PR description under a `### arm64 SIGURG reproducer` heading.
