// runShutdown performs a BEST-EFFORT Live-state flush before the run
// loop tears the connection down. The contract is deliberately narrow:
//
//   - If drainDeadline > 0, TryNext is called in a tight loop until
//     the deadline elapses, the reader reports ok=false (caught up),
//     the reader reports an error, or a Send failure breaks the loop.
//     The batcher is then Drain'd and any final batch is sent.
//   - If drainDeadline <= 0, no additional records are pulled; only
//     the already-buffered batch (if any) is flushed.
//   - CloseSend is called last so the server observes the half-close.
//
// runShutdown does NOT guarantee that the server has processed the
// drained records before the run loop's subsequent full Close of the
// conn. The server-side contract for "graceful drain" would require
// the client to wait for the server's FIN (Recv loop returning EOF)
// between CloseSend and Close; this MVP does not implement that wait
// because the recv-goroutine integration still lives outside the Run
// loop (Task 22/27). In the current wiring, runLive's stopCh arm
// calls runShutdown and then immediately full-Close's the conn, so
// the server may see an abort instead of a graceful half-close for
// frames that were still in flight when CloseSend landed.
//
// Send/encode failures during drain are swallowed: a broken conn
// cannot be fixed at this layer, and shutdown callers cannot act on
// a partial-flush diagnostic. Loss markers produce TransportLoss
// frames on the wire - a TransportLoss IS the integrity boundary,
// so the drain continues after a loss marker is flushed.
//
// runShutdown is only called from runLive - runReplaying and
// runConnecting each have their own exit paths and no buffered batcher
// to drain.
