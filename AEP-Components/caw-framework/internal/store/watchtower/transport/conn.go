// Conn is the abstraction over a bidirectional WTP gRPC stream so that
// transport tests can substitute a fake.
//
// Concurrency contract (mirrors gRPC's ClientStream):
//   - A single sender goroutine and a single receiver goroutine MAY
//     operate concurrently - i.e. one Send may overlap one Recv.
//   - Multiple concurrent Senders are NOT safe.
//   - Multiple concurrent Receivers are NOT safe.
//   - CloseSend MUST NOT race with a concurrent Send. Callers are
//     responsible for sequencing Send and CloseSend on the sender
//     goroutine.
//
// Lifecycle contract:
//   - CloseSend is the half-close primitive: it signals "no more sends"
//     to the peer. Recv may still return data the peer had queued before
//     observing the half-close. The underlying stream/connection remains
//     open until the peer drains and closes its sending half (or until
//     Close is called).
//   - Close is the full-teardown primitive: it aborts the stream and
//     releases all resources. After Close, Send/Recv/CloseSend MUST
//     return an error (or be no-ops). Close MUST be idempotent so error
//     paths can call it without coordinating with a successful close.
//   - After Close returns, any in-flight blocked Send or Recv MUST
//     unblock promptly with an error. Implementations of Conn over real
//     gRPC ClientStreams satisfy this naturally because closing the
//     underlying ClientConn cancels in-flight RPCs; fakes used in tests
//     must arrange for the same behavior.
