// inflightTracker tracks the (generation, sequence) high-watermarks of
// frames that have been Sent but not yet covered by an
// AckOutcomeAdopted BatchAck. Both EventBatch and TransportLoss frames
// are tracked symmetrically - the high-watermark is the frame's
// to_sequence, regardless of frame type. A BatchAck whose
// ack_high_watermark_seq retires entries up to that sequence covers
// both kinds uniformly (the WTP server treats TransportLoss as a
// metadata frame that advances the watermark, just like a data batch).
//
// The WTP protocol allows a single BatchAck to coalesce
// acknowledgements for multiple frames via its AckHighWatermarkSeq +
// Generation tuple, so a counter that decrements by one per ack would
// under-release the inflight window against any conforming server that
// batches acknowledgements (roborev Medium round-3). Release pops every
// pending entry whose high-watermark is at or below the adopted ack's
// (gen, seq) tuple.
//
// Pending entries are appended in send order; the protocol guarantees
// (gen, seq) is monotonically non-decreasing across successive Sends
// on the same connection, so a prefix-pop is correct.

// its generation is strictly lower, or its generation matches AND its
// sequence is at or below the ack sequence. A higher-generation
// entry is always above the ack regardless of sequence (the ack
// belongs to a prior generation that has rolled over).
