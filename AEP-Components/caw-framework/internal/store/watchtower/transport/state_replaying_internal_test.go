// RunReplayingForTest is the external test seam for runReplaying. The
// production runReplaying is unexported (see state_replaying.go header)
// because it is missing the recv multiplexer the spec requires for
// stateReplaying (design.md:565); shipping it as an exported method
// would let production callers outside the transport package wire it
// into a run loop without realising it would silently drop inbound
// BatchAck/ServerHeartbeat/SessionUpdate/Goaway frames during long
// replays.
//
// The unexport is an EXTERNAL-CALL-SITE GUARD, not a compile-time
// guarantee: callers inside the transport package can still call
// runReplaying directly. Production wiring inside the package (Task 22's
// Run loop) MUST gate the call behind the recv-multiplexer plumbing
// Tasks 17/18 introduce. See the Task 22 Run-loop snippet in
// docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-18-wtp-client.md "Task 16 - Deferred
// to Task 17/18" for the structural dependency. Until then, only tests
// reach runReplaying - via this helper, which lives in *_test.go and is
// compiled out of the production binary.
//
// Tests using this seam MUST also override buildEventBatchFn via
// SetBuildEventBatchFnForTest (the default stub returns an empty
// ClientMessage that would put invalid frames on the wire if a Send
// went through to a real server).

// drive runReplaying with a non-stub builder. Returns a restore func the
// caller MUST defer to put the production stub back; without the
// restore, leaking a test override into another test would corrupt the
// global function variable.
//
// The supplied fn receives only the WAL records; the emitExtended bool is
// ignored by test stubs that return a fixed ClientMessage regardless of
// reason gating. Production tests that need to verify reason-gating
// behavior should use the full store-level component tests
// (component_inflight_loss_test.go) instead of this low-level seam.
